The bill would authorize over 3 trillion dollars of new spending measurs on top of the almost 3 trillion the U.S. Congress has already spent on the previous 2 stimulus packages. 

This bill is expected to get a vote Friday, 3 days after being released, with little to no debate on how this spending will actually benefit the economy. NO solutions on how to repay this borrowed money, NO infrastructure plan to generate jobs and update an aging infrastructure. Just more spending on top of the ONE TRILLION dollar annual budget deficit and Medicare/Social Security insolvency issue we already face. How is this acceptable for our seniors.

Current members of Congress need to awnser why this is acceptable. The members authorizing this spending will be retired and out of office when my generation will have to deal with their reckless spending. Its time for new leadership.

Any smart businessman would look at making cuts in the area of wages and benefits, before allowing any services for the children to be cut.

Out of the huge $31,000,000.00 budget....$24,800,000.00 goes towards wages and benefits....leaving only a paltry $6,200,000.00 for everything else. Lavish wages and Cadillac benefit plans have sucked our school district dry and bankrupted the system. 

This group of bumbling amateurs on the school board bears sole responsibility for this financial travesty and squandering of taxpayer's money for the benefit of the Union employees.

The Board of education has lost sight of the fact that they work for the taxpayers, not the teachers union. What is best for the administrators and teachers, has superseded what is in the best interest of our children's education.

The smoking gun of this truth, I am speaking of, is in the fact that there are ZERO cuts in wages and benefits for this protected ""core group"" of employees, as Cozad likes to refer to them.

The wage freeze, Cozad brags and boasts about is an illusion. Once the levy is passed, then all freezes are over, and past due/frozen wages are returned/paid up. The Union members lose nothing. Its all an accounting trick of smoke and mirrors.

Why are these employees protected from the reality of the schools overspending?

The school board relinquished its ""power of the purse"" to the teachers union, which is at the core of this financial disaster. The School board and teachers union has forsaken the best interests of the children, in exchange for the financial interests of lining the union member's wallets.

Why are the teachers and administrators not having to take a pay cut, when the community is suffering from the effects of Ohio's shutdown?

The teachers are getting full pay and benefits, during this shutdown. The idea that they are ""still working"" has turned in to an open joke. The teachers get paid for 7.5 hours per day, 5 days per week, 182day per year. Yet during this shutdown, most have worked less than one hour per day. I do not believe the Allerton Hill propaganda talking points the school administration is putting out. 

None of this silliness would have been allowed to happened if this was a business.
 
We are NOT ""all in this together"".
The teachers have not lost their homes or businesses. They have not laid awake all night wonder how they will feed their families or pay their bills. These teachers and administrators have not given up one paycheck, and yet, demand that this levy gets passed. The majority of whom do not even live in our community, will not pay the tax if passed, yet demand you tax yourself and neighbors so that they can get a $3,3000,000.00 yearly pay raise. In four more years, they have admitted they will be back for another $3,300,000.00 property tax levy.

In fact, the Yes PAC has bragged that the school board plans on having a new levy every four years, for the next forty years!!

Email from Cozad to the school parents. 

District Parents and Staff,

I wanted to provide you with another update on the district‚Äôs recent levy request. As of Monday, May 11, according to the Greene County Board of Elections, 1,151 outstanding ballots were returned between April 28 and the May 8 deadline set by the Secretary of State. 

On April 28, according to unofficial results, the vote was 53 percent no and 47 percent yes for Issue 9. And while the Board of Elections is currently counting the votes from these outstanding ballots, I am remaining hopeful that these ballots could make a difference in the outcome of this election.

Official results will not be known until May 19, which is when the Board of Elections must submit the official tally of all valid votes, so we will hold off on making any official announcement until we receive the official results. If the levy does indeed fail, then I do want you to be aware that the district plans on moving forward with Phase III and IV reductions, totaling a cumulative $2,458,756 over the next two years.

The next Board of Education meeting will take place virtually on Thursday, May 21 at 7 PM. The link for the meeting can be found on the district website: http://www.sugarcreek.k12.oh.us. 
 

I will send to you another update once we receive the official election outcome. Thank you for remaining patient with us as we await this outcome and thank you for your continued support of our schools.

 

Sincerely,

Doug Cozad

Still, more than two dozen U.S. cities claim to be the ""birthplace of Memorial Day,"" and past leaders, like Lyndon B. Johnson, have not been shy about placing credit for the now nationwide holiday. But in true U.S. fashion, our history hasn't been considered within the conversation of its roots. And like many other instances, it was discovered late in the game that Black people did it first.

According to history.com, ""It wasn't until a remarkable discovery in a dusty Harvard University archive the late 1990s that historians learned about [this] Memorial Day commemoration organized by a group of freed black slaves less than a month after the Confederacy surrendered in 1865."" #PushBlack #TodayInBlackHistory

By marching on that spring day, these brave rebels with a cause shined light on the violence Black children also experience. While many were concerned about sending their babies to protest, it led to pivotal changes in the struggle for Black liberation. #PushBlack #TodayInBlackHistory

But Civil Rights activist Medgar Evers who was a field secretary for the NAACP at the time, was assigned to investigate the murder. And would discover that Lee had received a threatening note to end his voter registration work just three days before he was killed. Still, the case ran dry, and justice went unserved.

Still, Reverend George Lee's death had the attention of Black people all over the country, making his funeral a media frenzy. Planting the seed for Emmett Till's mother, who would bury her son as a result of racist violence just two months later, Lee's widow, Rosebud Lee, decided to hold an open-coffin ceremony.
‚Äì‚Äì
In 2008, the FBI reopened the case as part of the Department of Justice's ""Cold Case"" initiative. The reopened files exposed the two suspects in the murder case who were both members of the white citizens council--which was no secret to Belzoni's Black community. However, the suspects had died in the 70s, so a local prosecutor refused to take Lee's case to a grand jury. #PushBlack #TodayInBlackHistory

This election is very important for the future of McKenzie County. There are 3 seats open which has the potential to control the entire Commission if you vote for alliances. It is my belief that we as voters need to make diverse picks on the ballot. Knowing not only where the candidates stand but who they stand with. If you think that past decisions were wrong, ask some questions first. Who benefits from these decisions? Who owns the land under or around? Which candidates are friends or associates? It is my goal to ask these questions now as I cast my vote and in the future if I make it on the Commission in November.

Ridiculous!

This virus is indeed a real thing and needs to be taken seriously.  We needed to take action in March and we did, both as a state and as a country.  But the data accrued and the reality in the ground since shows us that we CAN and MUST move forward with our lives and reb up this economy and begin to nurture our country back to health.  

We have already modified our behavior and no sane person is recommending we disregard the coronavirus threat.  We simply need to find a sane and reasonable balance.  South Dakota never shut down and has the 43rd lowest death rate per capita from Covid-19 in the country.  Despite some deceptive and out of context coverage about Sweden‚Äôs failure (they haven‚Äôt shut down either), they are actually making it through successfully.  

Facts are stubborn things and this virus is dangerous to folks that are over 65 AND have underlying health conditions.   For the rest of us the survival rate hovers around 99.99%.  Oh but how the media revels in showing us the outliers, the young healthy person that succumbed to this awful affliction.  There are cases like this.  Just like there are cases where teenagers die from heart attacks.  They‚Äôre tragic yes.  But fortunately incredibly rare.  Stopping them completely is a pointless folly akin to trying to stop the wind from blowing.  

One life loss is one too many.  It‚Äôs sad.  We lose nearly 40,000 Americans each year to car accidents.  Should we then ban cars from the roads?  After all, doing so will, as we hear from the left so often these days, save lives.  

This challenge we face today is not Covid 19 v the economy/jobs this is Covid 19 v civilization as we know it.  A prolonged overreaction, errrr shutdown, errrr ‚Äòsafer-at-home‚Äô, will, in the end cost more lives.  People need cancer screenings and cardiovascular checkups and a myriad of other preventative health care measures.  A drop in cancer diagnosis, which has indeed happened, isn‚Äôt something to rejoice about.  On the contrary is something be be incredibly alarmed about.  Incidents of actual cancer aren‚Äôt suddenly and miraculously dropping, it‚Äôs just that many folks are going into the hospital or their doctor offices to get checkups because they fear contracting this virus-while another silent killer is a much greater threat to them.  

The solution is to be rational and to look at the actual data and science and keep the political prism in the drawer.  If we don‚Äôt open up the economy and allow people to work, to play, to live, to love, to dance, to laugh, to give, to fly, to soar, to learn, to breath (unmasked) and to scrape an occasional knee, then we risk doom.  We risk losing society-our civilized form and process of being, one that has embraced us, protected us and inoculated us from chaos.  It has fostered and facilitated heretofore unknown historical prosperity.  We owe it to our children and our shared future as much as we do our ancestors and all that they sacrificed for us, to move boldly forward.  Courage my friends.  

We will be careful, we will be cautious, we will be considerate and we will be smart.  What we will NOT be is afraid!

-Make the roads safer for the motorists of Montgomery County
-Pave more county roads
-Install reflectors between the yellow lines for better visibility at night
-Ensure all guardrails are up to state and federal regulations
-Work to minimize storm water run off on all county right-of-ways
-Mend the bridges in Montgomery County back into better shape
-Conduct town hall style meetings with the taxpayers of Montgomery County to hear their concerns
-Implement a roadside trash pickup regiment 
-Make sure to keep the taxpayers dollars in Montgomery County when making purchases
-Make the working atmosphere better for the employees at the Highway Department 
-Implement a better right-of-way mowing program to get them done more efficiently and look better
-Work to keep the guardrails trimmed around and keep brush, grass and tree limbs trimmed at intersections for better visibility for motorists
-Implement a better way of keeping the equipment more up to date and safer for the employees
* I would also like to clarify some rumors one of my opponents is telling the public.
If elected, Mayor Jim Durrett will not be working at the Highway Department and I will not be contracting mowing and paving out that is a guarantee! I promised I would run a clean campaign and that‚Äôs what I plan on doing. I feel that if people want to spread lies I‚Äôll just pray for them.

He brought this letter to our home with sincerest apologies.

HOW WRONG I WAS ABOUT STEVE LEIBEL

In a letter to the editor [of the Dahlonega Nugget] last week, I said too many candidates were handicapped‚Äîthey had no ears. I said 17 brochures arrived in my mailbox but only 2 had a phone number printed thereon to make it easy to talk to candidates. Well, I must also be handicapped (no eyes) as Steve Leibel‚Äôs material DEFINITELY had a phone number. 
I also said Steve did not call me after I wrote him 2 different emails with that request. That was correct, but only because my emails went to his spam folder. He actually combed his spam folder, found my request, and called me before he was aware of my critical letter to the editor‚Äîa letter that could not be changed because the paper had already gone to print.
I have since met Steve by phone and in person. Smart guy with common sense. Talks straight without playing both sides of the fence. Has accomplished enough as the world counts success that he could play big shot. However, has a sincere servant approach to life.
I apologize to Steve and to NUGGET readers for getting it wrong when I lumped him in with the other candidates who don‚Äôt seem to have ears. Steve has no hearing deficiency!

""I've known Kenny ever since he started with the Muscatine Sheriff‚Äôs office. For the last couple of years, I‚Äôve worked with him at the Durant Police Department where he also serves as a part-time officer. I admire his goals to make changes to the Sex Offender Registry Program and to create his Jobs Over Jails program. He also has a goal to improve community outreach by getting deputies involved, and that is something I admire and try to emulate within our agency as well. Kenny is a valuable resource to us when things come up and we have questions. We‚Äôve reached out to him, and he has been able to help us with his knowledge and experience. 

Kenny has great leadership qualities. He is professional and ethical in his approach to things, and I think that will benefit Muscatine County. I think he would make an excellent Sheriff.""

""I would like to take a moment of your time to endorse the re-election of Patty Perlow to the office of Lane Country District Attorney.

As a layman in the community, I‚Äôve been associated with Lane County‚Äôs criminal corrections programs for nearly 40 years. I‚Äôve served three sheriffs as an advisor. I also spent many years as a member and chairman of the Lane County Community Corrections Advisory Committee working closing with law enforcement officers, corrections officers, judges and prosecutors. 

The job of the district attorney is demanding both physically and mentally. My observation is the present District Attorney is handling the job well and deserves to be re-elected. Throughout my life I‚Äôve been  fortunate enough to supervise wage earners of many different crafts and skills. I‚Äôve always been very  supportive of those people who do their job well and who bring integrity to the workplace. 

I believe the present district attorney fits this criteria. Please join myself, the Lane County Sheriff, a retired Lane County District Attorney and many others from the corrections and law enforcement field and re-elect Patty Perlow to another term as our District Attorney.""

During this challenging time, a top question that may come to mind is How is Wildwood's government prepared to handle this economic turbulence?

The answer is that we are financially sound and well positioned for situations like this! It gives me great pleasure to share that Wildwood's finances are in fact built to handle the impact of economic shocks. I'll explain why.

First, a little background. The City of Wildwood's budget has various funds, or let's say buckets, they are:
‚ñ™Ô∏èGeneral Fund is the operating fund for the city and all operating expenditures are included in this fund.
‚ñ™Ô∏èCapital Improvements Fund must be used for construction, maintenance, and operation of capital improvements for capital projects.
‚ñ™Ô∏èRoad & Bridge Fund can only be used for roadway and bridge construction, maintenance, and acquisition.
‚ñ™Ô∏èEast & West Traffic Generation Assessment (TGA) Funds are special revenue funds that receive contributions from residential development activity for the improvement of major roadways made necessary by and to serve the development of property in areas of the city.

The city's operations rely on the General Fund, hence its name. Beginning in 2020, the General Fund balance was an estimated $15.5 million. We projected 2020 revenues (pre-pandemic) at $11.3 million and operating expenditures (pre-pandemic) to be $11.2 million. Henceforth, keeping the healthy savings in the bank of $15.5 million. 

Of the $15.5 million, we already have aside Operating Contingency for unexpected situations equal to 25% of budgeted expenditures, leaving $11.5 million as a budgeted unreserved fund balance. Consider it, money saved for a rainy day.

What does this tell us? We would be able to fund the city for a full year even with $0 in revenue. Of course, these are extreme scenarios because while revenue will decrease during a period of economic crisis, costs will decrease as well due to reduced, cancelled, or postponed expenditures.

Folks may ask, well how does our General fund balance compare to other nearby cities? The answer is very good! 

Another aspect that well positions Wildwood for fluctuations in revenues is that personnel costs account for a small portion of expenditures, while in most cities it accounts for about 60% of expenditures. Many cities have large payrolls due to extensive parks/recreation facilities and programs, public works departments, police departments, and other areas. Wildwood is able to run our city with a payroll of less than 30 employees. This minimizes our salary and benefit expenditures because we have contractors do most of the work.

During times of contraction, we're able to tone down contractor expenses due to less use. A perfect example, is currently with the closure of playgrounds and restroom facilities. This model works out nicely for us, because we can scale down versus having to consider cutting positions.

Naturally, given the uncertainty and impacts we will see on sales tax revenues over the next few months, it will be important for officials to make adjustments during the mid-year budget review. Wildwood's City Charter Section 6.7.(b) states that the City Administrator will report on any remedial actions taken and recommendations for the City Council to consider.

For those that are concerned, rest assured we are in a position of strength to manage through the financial turbulence and we'll be making sound and rational decisions with the data presented to us. More to come.",Joe Garritano for Wildwood,999,USD,99,0,0,1,1

Destroying the economy of our nation is not responsible or rational behavior, no matter the reason. Our government from federal to state is betraying us with the greatest mistake in history. Don't believe the hype. With no cure for Coronavirus, no rational leader ruins the future to try to save 1/2 of 1% of citizens, which it cannot do, and trashes the 99.5% in order to do it. 

Flattering the curve means the government has to flatten the people. This is wrong.

I enjoy the work, serving the public and feel competent to accomplish the duties and responsibilities required of me in that position. I look forward to working with others to accomplish the tasks at hand for our county.

Here's a list of truths that have come out recently:

#1 Although critics have accused me of being unfair by not stating ""unexpired term"" on the 2018 ballots, Commissioners acknowledged during a recent meeting that no Election Administrator in our county has used that phrase on any ballot for decades, including positions up for election in the County Attorney seat and Treasurer's seat, where the ""unexpired term"" should've been stated. As Election Administrator in 2018 I followed the precedent that had been set before me.

#2 Critics have blamed me for our current Clerk and Recorder not knowing her term limit, but have failed to acknowledge that I submitted the article to our local paper that clearly defined the term limit for the clerk's seat before the 2018 election.

#3 Critics allege that my husband and I are ""lawsuit happy."" That allegation hits on several personal issues, including an accident that injured my husband and an easement issue with a neighbor, both of which sided in our favor. I'll address this topic with any voter that asks.

#4 Critics allege that the Injunction filed was done to hurt the Commissioners and/or our county. This is false and misrepresents actions taken. Under advice of counsel the Injunction was filed because our Board of County Commissioners passed a resolution that violated state law. Again I am willing to elaborate on this topic with any voter that asks.

I agree with voters who have expressed their concerns with me regarding this election cycle‚Äôs negative news coverage. Unfounded allegations that misrepresent me or any other candidate only hurt Prairie County.  Unsubstantiated allegations, based on innuendos and assumptions do not belong in our county discourse. We're better than that! 

Although I haven‚Äôt reached out to reporters or initiated phone calls with them, I most certainly have answered their calls and the questions they posed to me.

I am and will continue to run a positive campaign and regardless of the outcome I am proud and happy to be a Prairie County citizen. I've appreciated the kind and generous actions of many shown towards me and my husband and towards others in our community. I enjoyed my work in the Clerk and Recorder's office in 2015-18 and felt competent in the duties and responsibilities required of me. I am willing and ready to work with anyone. And with your vote I look forward to working for Prairie County!

By Carter Eugene Adams
carter@theportager.com

Financial stress from the Covid-19 pandemic is already starting to affect the Village of Garrettsville in the form of road maintenance delays.

Garrettsville is down $108,000 from this time last year because of the July 15 tax filing deadline extension and the coronavirus pandemic, Village Council President Tom Hardesty said at their public meeting, broadcast yesterday via Facebook Live.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know if the money is deferred or if it‚Äôs because of people out of work,‚Äù Hardesty said. ‚ÄúBut we know we don‚Äôt have it in hand.‚Äù 

The delay in tax revenue has led to delays in road maintenance, with the process of bidding on road resurfacing pushed back to August or later. 

Despite the year-to-date drop in taxes, the village still has money in the bank, Hardesty said.  

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre certainly going to be in sound shape,‚Äù Hardesty said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to be without funds.‚Äù

The pandemic is also disrupting the traditional Memorial Day Parade and celebration. The village will be holding a virtual ceremony, Mayor Rick Patrick announced during the meeting. He also said Summerfest will likely be canceled, though they have not reached a final decision pending a June 1 meeting.

They also discussed an ordinance about who should be responsible for maintaining detention ponds within the village, most notably in housing developments. The measure, ordinance 2020-08, would put the fiscal responsibility on the homeowners associations rather than the village. 

Ultimately they tabled the measure for further review to ensure its language would cover all detention ponds within the village and not just a few.

Ward 3 Shawnee Residents of Western Shawnee,

I posted my 1st two months in review at the end of February (see below) and had hoped to conduct quarterly Town Hall meetings (which is not possible during COVID lock-down), so here‚Äôs another installment as I work to keep you informed on what has been happening at City Hall over the past couple of months.  

My take and votes on the more consequential issues and decisions, starting w/ the most recent:

1.) We have continued to receive COVID-19 updates from staff throughout the pandemic.  City staff has made many changes including closing many public offices and having employees work from home, pushing back court dockets, etc.  However, I am pleased to report that basic city services have essentially not been interrupted and staff has done a terrific job continuing to serve the citizens of Shawnee.  Things will begin to slowly get back to normal in accordance w/ the Johnson County Phased opening plan.  Check the City website for most recent updates.  Our city staff has done an incredible job throughout this crisis and I want to give them a lot of credit.

Financially, I am concerned about the impact to the City budget and most importantly concerned about the impact to our local businesses.  While the economic impact will no doubt hit the City of Shawnee hard as well, we are in a relatively good place compared to neighboring cities based on a few factors:  1.) We have a significant amount in reserves currently.  2.) The percent of sales tax we depend on is much less than neighboring cities (typically a disadvantage but in this case works to our favor).  3.) Shawnee has a relatively large percent of ‚Äúessential businesses‚Äù, so the percent that had to close during this time, while painful, is less than many cities.  4.) We don‚Äôt have large monthly mortgage or bond payments such as a convention center or community center w/ associated employees that have to be paid.  All of these put us in a relatively better position.

Personally, I launched a Facebook Page named ""Support Shawnee Local"" early-on and have been putting my own money behind advertising/ championing many of the small businesses here in Western Shawnee.  I have appreciated the help of Jason Keeler, who has provided the technical expertise to target ads and help w/ this project.  YOU have done an incredible job supporting our local restaurants, and I am hopeful that they will survive.  Thank You!  Small businesses and restaurants are the life-blood of our community!  

Additionally, the City of Shawnee received $169,000 in COVID-related Block Grants (hope to receive more) and the Council was charged with how best to spend this money.  My motion to spend 2/3 of it supporting rent or mortgages for small businesses and giving 1/3 of it to community organization partners to pass onto individuals in need was the motion that passed out of Council.  As a result, 2/3 of this money will go to small businesses (intent of 50 employees or less) who have remained open or temporarily closed but are struggling.  We hope to also match this amount from the General Fund so that we can help as many businesses and protect as many small business jobs as possible.  Hopefully we will also be receiving more money through this program to dole out.

Finally, I have been a strong supporter of opening the Shawnee Pool this summer.  Many including Fairway, Prairie Village, etc. have already made the decision not to open.  I believe that throughout the pandemic, our Parks and Recreation spaces have been a bright spot in people‚Äôs days.  The pool is no different.  Our children have been locked up for 2 months!  Symbolically, it is important to give them the opportunity to go to the pool this summer.  As a result, staff has come up with a detailed plan which we believe will allow us to open 1 pool, with occupancy restrictions and social distancing.  However, resurgence of infection rates and the timeline of County Phases could cause changes to this current plan of action.  If we can make it happen in a safe manner, we will.  I will continue to champion this effort.

2.) At our most recent City Council Meeting on 5/11/2020, discussion regarding City Manager Sunderman‚Äôs contract and performance was reviewed.  I personally have been impressed with Mr. Sunderman‚Äôs performance and have appreciated our interactions.  As a personnel matter, this discussion was conducted in Executive Session without the Public and therefore I can‚Äôt speak to specifics, but the bottom line was that he was given an incredible 25% pay increase ($37,000) as the result of a 4-4 Council tie that was broken by the Mayor.  He was granted this raise on a 5-4 total vote.  I voted against this incredible increase as I believe it is very fiscally irresponsible, especially in-the-midst of the COVID-19 crisis where so many are losing their jobs and making less that ever before.  This is an example of why it is so important for the public to vote for elected officials who will be responsible with YOUR money!  

3.) At our 4/27/2020 City Council Meeting I took the vote I struggled with most personally up until this point.  I voted to approve the proposed Belmont-Promenade Project which will eventually bring Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods to Shawnee to anchor the new shopping center which will be located on the Southwest corner of Shawnee Mission Parkway and Mauer.  I opposed the proposed Community Improvement District which will levy an additional 1.6% sales tax in this area (see below posts regarding a previous vote on this CID project).  I even tried to make a motion at this meeting that would have ensured the additional CID percentages be posted throughout the shopping area to no avail.  However, after hearing from multiple residents, considering the difficulty of developing that corner of our city topographically and believing that this shopping district (anchored by Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods and including additional restaurants) ‚Ä¶ in total I decided to vote for the project based on the degree of value I believe this project will bring to our community and the desire of our residents to have it.  

4.) Also, at our 4/27/2020 meeting, we were asked to add additional funding to move a project for Old Shawnee Town forward.  Specifically, the proposal is to build a replica of the ‚ÄúDoc Sullivan‚Äôs House‚Äù at a budgeted price-tag of $500,000.  This would be the 22nd building added to Old Shawnee Town.  I could not, in good conscience, vote in favor of yet another building in Old Shawnee Town at this amount of cost (especially given the current budget crisis).  I voted against this proposal and I will again as it continues to come up (different phases) in the future.  I lost on a 5-3 vote.  

5.) Fiscal Transparency: Since joining the Council, I have been following up on and asking for increased transparency when it comes to the city‚Äôs expenditures.  This is not necessarily anyone‚Äôs fault, but due in part to a new Financial operating system, several expenditures were not itemized on the publicly reported expenditures report.  Therefore, I have continually followed up and as a result of myself (and others) the city finance department has changed this process to itemize out all expenditures.  Additionally, at the last meeting I brought forward my concern that many large expenses are only referenced by project number instead of a descriptor on the line item.  As a result, staff plans to change this as well. These changes will improve transparency and ensure fiscal responsibility which is good.

6.) Woodsonia Apartment Update:  There is none.  At present, the developer has sued the city and we are currently at a stalemate.  I will keep you up-to-date as things progress.

My priorities remain the same:
1.) Ensure fiscal responsibility at the city level
2.) Ensure excellent basic city services and infrastructure
3.) Support local businesses
4.)    Support our First Responders (police & fire) 
5.)    Support our Parks and Recreation
6.) Fight for Families (and everyone) in Western Shawnee

Right now, things are very different for us as we try to navigate this pandemic and keep him safe and healthy. My son‚Äôs lungs are so damaged due to his condition, I don‚Äôt see how he could survive this virus. 

My husband and I don‚Äôt leave the house unless we have absolutely no other choice. We don‚Äôt open the door for anyone on our porch. We have everything delivered and once it arrives we leave it outside until we have to bring it in. I was sorting through our mail with gloves on until we ran out. My husband had stroke symptoms recently, but there was no way we could even go to the ER. Leaving our son at home alone, and potentially exposing ourselves and bringing the virus home, is out of the question. 

I wish people understood the threat this virus poses for so many of our loved ones. This is scary for the average person, but it‚Äôs terrifying for those who are already compromised. As home care workers, we need PPE to keep us and those we serve safe. Right now, we have no protections and we are two months into this crisis. We need to see action NOW. - Lillie, Effingham, IL",SEIU,1999,USD,99,0,0,1,1

‚úÖ Honest + Transparent. Values which are embedded in the core of his personality, Devin believes these values are essential to becoming or being a politician.  Devin will work for the people of District 4 and Winneshiek County, not himself. 

‚úÖ Invested + Local. Devin was born, raised and is invested in Winneshiek County.  Devin has a passion of helping the county grow through economic policies that don‚Äôt raise your taxes.  Devin‚Äôs investment in agriculture proves his work ethic and aligns him to represent the interests of our county‚Äôs deep roots in agriculture. 

‚úÖ Roads. Everyone mentions it, nobody tackles it.  Our secondary road system is a disaster, it‚Äôs worth fixing and is vital to commerce in Winneshiek County.  Tackling this issue isn‚Äôt for the faint of heart, it‚Äôs going to require a leader with an innovative intellect.  Devin possess this and is committed to seeing to it our roads are finally given the same level of care as other county services.

‚úÖ Public Safety + Mental Health.  Devin fully supports our heroes who choose to sacrifice their own lives for the safety of others day in and day out.  Our police officers, dispatchers, fire fighters and EMS personnel need more representation, because without them we might not be here today.  Access to mental health is also critical to ensuring our public safety resources are not overwhelmed.

‚úÖ No More Taxes + Reduced Spending.  The answers to our issues do not require tax hikes.  Fiscally responsible decision making is the approach needed, common sense does not always work. Fiscally responsible decision making involves critical thinking and problem-solving skills, two skill sets Devin holds.  Supervisors have an obligation to ensure spending of taxpayer dollars is appropriate and necessary to our economic development.  Devin will work tirelessly to ensure your hard-earned money is put to use to improve our county and is not wasted on services you stand against. 

‚úÖ More than Decorah. There is more to Winneshiek County than Decorah.  Citizens outside of Decorah often feel their voices are not heard because they do not live in Decorah.  This is a very unfortunate reality in which Devin will ensure ends. Your voice, thoughts, ideas and feedback will be heard and represented once again.",Devin Humpal for Supervisor - District 4,999,USD,99,0,0,1,1

A Virtual Meeting Hosted by Holmdel First and CILU

Did you know that some towns hold local elections on a nonpartisan basis? This allows voters to decide based on the character and reputation of the candidates and what they can do for the town rather than along party lines.

Come and hear more about the benefits and the procedure for nonpartisan elections for local government!

The event is free but you‚Äôll need to register to receive a link by email to the event.  You can also send an email to HolmdelFirst@gmail.com to receive a link to register.

When: May 28, 2020, 7 ‚Äì 8 PM

Registration: https://forms.gle/wkd4NnK2F5SNm93MA

Guest speaker is Kevin Starkey, a partner at the law firm Starkey, Kelly, Kenneally, Cunningham & Turnbach. Over the past 30 years, he has represented many municipal governments with both partisan and nonpartisan elections. He is currently the municipal attorney in Tinton Falls, one of the few towns in New Jersey with nonpartisan elections.

Students have suffered as a result. Graduation rates are stagnating, and Michigan ranks in the bottom third of the country in terms of math and reading scores.

Now, during the pandemic, Trump and the GOP keep stonewalling relief funds for the Postal Service‚Äîeven though Congress quickly bailed out FedEx and UPS to the tune of $4 billion.

The death of the 245-year-old U.S. Postal Service would:

üì¶Cause over 600,000 workers‚Äînearly 40% of whom are workers of color‚Äîto lose their jobs, at a time when unemployment has hit its highest level since the Great Depression. The postal service is one of the biggest employers in the U.S.

üì¶Ensure that there‚Äôs no large-scale vote-by-mail campaign this November‚Äîvoter suppression is a Republican favorite.

Two bills passed with bipartisan support, and each included important safeguards to ensure that reopening occurs safely but also urgently. 

Governor Wolf should sign each of the bills.

House Bill 2412 would reopen our real estate industry, and is particularly urgent. 49 states allow real estate to safely operate. Pennsylvania, alone, does not.

Governor Wolf made that decision unilaterally, and he could change it in an instant. Instead, he has refused to reconsider or to even address the discrepancy. Now it seems he will veto this bill.

House Bill 2412 passed with unanimous Republican support, in addition to 25 Democrats. While I appreciate the votes of those Democratic Representatives, I can‚Äôt help but notice that they leave the bill just one vote short of a veto-proof majority in the House. Oddly, the vote in the Senate yesterday was‚Ä¶ also one vote shy of a veto-proof majority.

The essential housing needs of Pennsylvanians are not a political game. Neither is the safe reopening of a critical part of our economy.

Yet Democrats are cynically and transparently calculating precisely how much political cover they can give their own members, while still providing Pennsylvanians with no relief from Governor Wolf‚Äôs unnecessary and harmful real estate shutdown.

I hope you will join me in calling on Governor Wolf to sign these bills and to urgently move to open businesses that are safely operating across America.",Mike Heckmann for State Representative,999,USD,99,0,0,0,0

In fact, you could call this COVID-19 Early Voting! Both houses approved the measure and Governor McMaster just, moments ago, signed our bill into law. Please note the information in the attached graphic. Call 8439155440 to request your application to obtain an absentee ballot or you can appear in person from now until June 8th on weekdays from 9am to 5pm at the Horry County Election Commission office, 1515 Fourth Avenue, Conway.

He did it because he was offended that I stood my ground and did not back down to his abusive video. 

Pruett has over 60,000 followers on Facebook. Some of them chose to attack me on my campaign Facebook page because he was offended. Less than a dozen of his followers came to my page to support their leader. 

This is exactly the kind of nasty and abusive behavior we should not tolerate in Idaho. Voter‚Äôs names and phone numbers have been released, along with coordinated negative messaging. Additionally, there are many dishonest statements made towards good people running for office. All because they are standing their ground against a statewide political machine. 

Unlike my opposition, I will never engage in this type of abusive behavior toward women. Nor, anyone who is doing their best to serve the good people of our state. Dorothy Moon‚Äôs silent endorsement of this behavior is very telling.

I have zero tolerance for abusive behavior. Whether it‚Äôs violence towards women, children, or any Idahoan speaking their mind. I respect people‚Äôs safety and mental well being. I‚Äôve banned all abusive commenters and will continue to do so. I do this because they do not likely have an honest reason for engaging on this page.

 Friends, thank you for your continued support. I was told running against Dorothy Moon would be difficult. I was told my character would be viciously attacked. I knew I needed to have the strength and courage to stand up for what is right. I feel like I've been kicked in the gut because I care about our community. I can not do this alone. Your words of encouragement and support have kept me going. I commit to continue to work until the last ballot is cast on June 2.",LaVerne Sessions for Idaho,999,USD,99,0,0,1,1

The program will provide aid to Mississippi businesses in the following ways:

Phase 1: $60 million
‚ñ∂Ô∏è All businesses with less than 50 employees who filed Mississippi state income taxes in 2018, 2019, or eligible businesses who intend to file for 2020, and who were subject to any COVID-19 related state, municipal, and/or county required business closure or voluntary closure will receive a $2,000 relief check- no application required. Businesses covered in this phase include clothing stores, dance studios, barber shops, salons, restaurants, etc- any business forced to close by state or local government.

Phase 2: $240 million
‚ñ∂Ô∏è All businesses with less than 50 employees who filed Mississippi state income taxes in 2018, 2019, or eligible businesses who intend to file for 2020, and suffered any interruption in businesses due to COVID-19 may apply to receive up to $25,000 in grants to cover payroll, rent, utilities, mortgage interest payments and other eligible expenses incurred during the the COVID-19 outbreak. Approved applicants under this program will receive a base payment of $1,500 and can either (1) receive an additional $500 per full-time equivalent employee OR (2) itemize eligible expenses on the application form. 

A few notes on Phase 2
‚Ä¢Businesses who receive checks under Phase 1 WILL be able to apply for Phase 2 relief without restriction. 
‚Ä¢Businesses who DID NOT receive federal PPP funds will receive priority for the first 21 days of the program. After that period, businesses who received PPP funds will be allowed to apply, with a portion of their state aid offset based on the amount of the PPP loan.
‚Ä¢For the first 60 days of the Phase 2 program, $40 million will be reserved for minority-owned businesses. 
‚Ä¢Grants awarded will not be subject to tax. 

Phase 1 payments will be administered by DFA, and work has already begun to get payments sent to eligible business owners without delay. MDA will be responsible for developing the application process and administering grants in Phase 2. I will continue to provide updates regarding the application for Phase 2. 

Without question, the legislation we passed today is the most consequential of my short career in the legislature. Small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy, and their health will be essential during the long recovery ahead.

For thousands of families across the South Bronx, COVID-19 has deepened already existing fears and uncertainties: making rent, having job stability, and accessing medical care. 10,000+ New Yorkers have died due to the COVID-19 pandemic and I extend my deepest condolences to their families and loved ones.

I know what it‚Äôs like to grow up with these insecurities and fears. I spent 3 years of my childhood in New York City‚Äôs shelter system. Since then, I‚Äôve devoted my career to affordable housing. Beginning with my time with Congressman Serrano, I‚Äôve worked tirelessly over the last decade to build affordable housing for New Yorkers and center environmental justice. Now, my campaign is continuing to support our community by partnering with mutual aid efforts to deliver food and organize volunteers to support our community during this crisis.

The people of the South Bronx deserve a leader who is in touch with their experience. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm rejecting the corruptive force of big money and fighting for a working-class revolution that ensures that we can all get the care we need ‚Äî in normal times as well as emergencies. In Congress, I‚Äôll stand with the transformative politics of the squad to demand a Homes Guarantee, Universal Basic Income, and Medicare for all - policies that will center the needs of our families during this crisis and beyond. 

This race is filled with corporate-backed Democrats, that‚Äôs why Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other working-class fighters are counting on us to bring this home.

I grew up on a farm in Wisconsin, one of ten kids. My parents worked hard. They were good people.

I was not an easy child. I drank too much, was arrested for fighting several times, and moved from home when I was 17-years-old. I was at best, a ""C"" student. I skipped school regularly, once to go to Madison for a tattoo. 

After I barely graduated from high school I joined the Marines. Because of my history, my only option was to go to the infantry. They sent me around the world, and I loved it.

Sandy and I went to high school together. She would have nothing to do with me because I was such a rough character. But we wrote letters back and forth while I was in the Marines. She said she fell in love with me when she thought I had been killed in Beirut. We started dating after I returned to the States from Lebanon.

When I got out of the Marines, we moved to Colorado for an internship Sandy lined up in Boulder so she could complete the requirements for her college degree. I didn't have a job and we didn't have a place to live. I had a 1957 Ford pickup. She had a 1978 Mercury Zephyr. We had about $1200 between us. It worked out. Within days I had a job pumping gas and driving tow truck in Boulder. 

We married shortly thereafter and Kyle was born two years later. We also started to do foster care. We were mere kids ourselves.

I was hired to be a deputy with the Weld County Sheriff's Office. I was named Deputy of the Year for my conduct when a suspect pulled a gun on me. We never did capture him, however. We speculate he escaped across the border. To this day, I pray he never kills a cop.

We had more kids and we missed Wisconsin. I got a job as a patrol officer with the Sturgeon Bay Police Department and moved back to Wisconsin. 

I worked full time and went to college. I enjoyed it. I ultimately ended up with three degrees. My latest a Master Degree in Management and Organizational Behavior.

I attended the FBI National Academy and came up through the ranks in Sturgeon Bay, ultimately being named the Chief of Police. 

At the age of 46, I wanted greater challenges and came to Waterloo to be their Chief of Police. The catch; Sandy said she wanted to be more involved in foster care. Since then, in addition to our five biological kids, we've adopted six out of foster care.

That brings us to today and I want to be your Sheriff.",Trelka for Sheriff,1999,USD,99,0,0,1,1

Cast your ballot for John Long, Commissioner before it's too late!

District 2 Commissioner Candidates have contracted LDS (Long Derangement Syndrome). Weatherby and Knocke are severely symptomatic.

Johnny Knocke has not only proclaimed that he has solutions to all the world's problems, but by his actions deemed Long will no longer be a candidate!!! WHAATTT! Johnny Knocke a 32-year-old ""legend in his own mind"" believes he possesses the powers of God. Visit his website and Facebook page to be enlightened as to his sole supreme powers, solutions and arrogance. But please do not argue with him on his Facebook posts, because he will let you know how wrong you really are.

If that's not bizarre enough, Richard Weatherby was chastised by God (Knocke) for Richard's transgressions (https://tinyurl.com/ybpbprhc). In a four page attempt to redeem himself, Weatherby compares himself to Jesus: ""I have been placed here on this path to be a servant to the people ... Like Jesus showed his disciples when he washed their feet."" If Weatherby is truly the Servant he claims to be, does that mean he is going to donate his salary to the less fortunate? Is he going to wash your feet too? Don't disagree with him or his ""disciples,"" because he will block you from his Facebook page.

John Long on the other hand admits he is just a mere ""sinning"" mortal ""country boy"" if you will and a ""Simple Man,"" having no doubt made many mistakes in his lifetime. In a recent interview, John Long claims he is a God Fearing Christian, but when asked if he has ever been a deacon or sung in a choir, he hung his head and shyly replied, ""No I haven't."" But as he gleefully raised his head he said, ""I've attended many southern rock concerts, drank wine like Jesus and sung along with all my rowdy friends."" Then he asked, ""Does that count?"" He then calmly urged, ""Everyone please relax, take a drink and vote for Long, your next Commissioner - The People's Voice.""

WHY OR WHY NOT?
 
I am in favor of murals and the guidelines that define their scope.
Murals, and public art in general, have the power to enhance our city‚Äôs image and make a statement to outsiders that creative people live here.  Moreover, public art can help to strengthen and define our city‚Äôs identity. The mural ordinance passed in 2019 is necessary to ensure that the art is not offensive or graphic and that no significant part of a building is obstructed or damaged in the process.  Other than those basic restrictions, artists are left to create.
Beyond supporting murals, I will be a mayor that encourages more arts and cultural activities. A vibrant arts scene enhances our quality of life and attracts visitors who spend money and help sustain our local businesses. People want to live in and visit cities where there is something to do.  We are competing against other cities for residents and tourists (and their dollars), and a thriving arts scene will help Frankfort standout and capture this business.  One of my campaign goals is to diversify our economy and reduce our reliance on state government, and an increased focus on art tourism will help.
We have many talented people in our community who give Frankfort a happening arts scene for a city our size. To support their continued efforts, I will work to implement the arts master plan that is currently in the works.  An increased commitment to the arts can help diversify our city‚Äôs economy and tax base, with the added benefit of making life more enjoyable for those of us fortunate to call Frankfort home.",Layne Wilkerson for Mayor of Frankfort,999,USD,99,0,0,1,1

There should be no place in government for this type of behavior and I urge  Dr. Oxiris Barbot to resign immediately.  #SuffolkGOP  #BacktheBlue  #Flipthe6",Anthony Palumbo for State Senate,3999,USD,99,0,0,0,0

#gojodeergo #wyodeer #knowyourcorridors
By day 35 of her migration, Jo made it to one of the most challenging segments of the entire corridor: the finger lakes region outside of Pinedale. This area about 90 miles into the corridor has many bottlenecks created by glacial lakes ‚Äî and barriers like fences, housing, and roads. The crucial bottlenecks are often less than a quarter-mile wide, but they provide migration passage to 4,000 or more deer in the Sublette Herd.

After leaving her Silver Creek stopover on April 23, Jo crossed the first of these bottlenecks at Boulder Lake. Here, Jo (and the entire herd) skirted around the 250-foot-deep lake by swimming across Boulder Creek right next to access roads and fishing areas. Depending on conditions, this creek can be an easy wade over sandbars, or a swift-flowing torrent. 

From Boulder Lake, Jo moved to the flanks of Half Moon Mountain, an 8,700-foot butte that looms a thousand feet above the surrounding sage lands. That‚Äôs where she was on April 27, closing out week four of her migration. 

The lakes around Pinedale were created by terminal moraines during two different periods of glaciation. The older period was the Bull Lake Glaciation from 200,000 to 130,000 years ago. The more recent period is called the Pinedale Glaciation, and it ended about 10,000 years ago. 

During those periods, rivers of ice coming out of the Wind River Range churned up sediment and massive boulders. The ice and till gouged out deep valleys, and then dropped all the material at the foot of the glaciers, building a succession of moraines that act as natural dams, creating some of the biggest lakes in Wyoming. (Some of these lakes also have constructed dams, like Boulder Lake, which store extra water for hay production, boosting the local economy.)

Mule deer have likely been contending with these lake barriers for hundreds or thousands of years. Today, their options to get around the lakes are more limited because the outlets of the lakes are popular for recreation and rural residential development. Migration data has helped managers and NGOs to recognize these migration bottlenecks, and take steps to conserve wildlife connectivity. If Jo does what we expect, next week she‚Äôll pass through the Luke Lynch Wildlife Habitat Management area, which the Wyoming Game and Fish Department the Wyoming office of The Conservation Fund, and other partners restored specifically for this migration corridor.

As of April 27, Jo still has several more lakes to get around if she wants to make it north to summer range, including one that can be deadly if spring ice hasn‚Äôt fully melted. We‚Äôll check in next week to see how Jo fares.

Over the past few months, we have seen the Governor‚Äôs Executive Powers expand beyond anything we ever imagined.  All governors have used these powers for a few days, maybe a week, for a hurricane or other disaster. But even during times of war, Virginians have not been governed by men at press conferences instead of laws passed by their duly elected legislators from across the state.  These emergency powers should never replace the rule of law cherished by conservatives and liberals alike.  

Starting in July, members of the General Assembly are allowed to begin filing bills for the 2021 General Assembly Session.  I have been thinking about our current situation quite often these days and it troubles me. Sixty-three days ago, our Governor declared a State of Emergency via Executive Order 51.  Since that time, the Commonwealth of Virginia has been governed by the Executive Orders (we are now up to Executive Order 63) and press conferences of a single individual.
 
As I‚Äôve pondered our situation, I‚Äôve decided that something must change.  So, I will be filing legislation for the 2021 General Assembly Session that will limit the Governor‚Äôs emergency powers beyond 60 days. Contrary to what some might say or believe, this actually has nothing to do with Republicans or Democrats. Our country and our Commonwealth should always operate by laws‚Ä¶not by men.  We should be run by a Constitutional government, not run by a single individual with a pen in hand.
 
At this point, I envision limiting the Governor‚Äôs emergency powers to 60 days.  At that time, the General Assembly must convene and decide the direction of the Commonwealth.  Decisions about our K-12 schools, our higher education institutions, business operations, healthcare, regionalism and infrastructure should be decided by the people‚Äôs body‚Ä¶the General Assembly.  We should also be the body that decides how to appropriate the hundreds of millions of dollars that are sent to Virginia from the federal government.  Right now, the Governor and his staff are making those decisions exclusively.  

To be clear, the Governor is operating under the Emergency Power we granted, so it‚Äôs our fault- not his - that we have allowed this form of government to evolve.  As you know, some of us have been urging the Governor to call the legislature back into session to provide a government by law, but that request has been rejected several times.  I know it might be much easier and more convenient to govern by decree‚Ä¶but that isn't our form of government, and it is not what our Founders had in mind for Virginians. 
 
Make no mistake‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt have any illusions that if this proposed system were in place today that the new left-leaning General Assembly wouldn‚Äôt remain in agreement with many of the Governor‚Äôs actions.  As I stated earlier‚Ä¶this is not about Republicans or Democrats.  It‚Äôs about a Constitutional government.  It‚Äôs about the voice of the citizens of Virginia being heard when a prolonged crisis impacts our Commonwealth.  Their voices are heard through their local elected representatives who live and work in their same community.  If each press conference‚Äôs edicts were considered as laws, the General Assembly could vet them, make amendments with the collective input from around the state, and come to a majority consensus.  Even if my perspective did not prevail in the end of this new system, we would still be operating under the Constitutional process and my voice would've at least been heard‚Ä¶that is, we would again be ruled by law- not by men.

""He‚Äôs championed everything from banning smoking on planes, to stopping sexual assault in the sky, to holding corporations like Boeing accountable.

He made his point. Thanks to DeFazio, pesticides were banned in our enclosed workplace.

And it‚Äôs not just aviation. DeFazio has been a champion for working people and the world we live in his entire career.

He helped secure $25 billion through the CARES Act to support transit systems around the country, including $37 million for transit here in Oregon‚Äôs 4th District. This will keep public transit running for millions of essential workers today and to ensure it‚Äôs there in years to come.

And he‚Äôs been a champion for our climate, too.

I WAS FURIOUS!

Here I was, promised that I would be SAVING money with solar and BOOM, I get the biggest energy bill of my LIFE! Not even close!

So I called the power company and asked what was going on. 

Then the lady on the phone asked, ‚ÄúDid you by chance get solar panels recently?‚Äù

I told her I had and she said, ‚ÄúOh, that makes sense. Let me adjust your bill.‚Äù 

My bill was then just $11 for the connection fee.üòçüòçüòç

Apparently I was producing so much power, that my meter was going  BACKWARDS and sending power back to the city.

And it flipped backwards past 0000000.

That was 5 years ago and I have not had a power bill like that again. 

Every month like clockwork it is just $11 to stay connected to the city.

And I run my A/C as much as I want, sometimes as low as 68 degrees.

I turn down my refrigerator so I have icy cold drinks all the time.

I run power how I want and when I want.

And it‚Äôs not irresponsible because I am producing clean energy and REDUCING my carbon footprint.

Not only that, my monthly payment on my solar panels was less than what my monthly electricity bill was.

I am SAVING money on the front and on the back.

And once my panels were paid off, my bill continued to be just $11 per month.

The one thing I can tell you, is GET SOLAR.

As we near the end of election time, I am reflecting on what this experience has been for me as a candidate, as an attorney, as a prosecutor, as a District Attorney and as a Lane County resident for 35 years.  I have raised my family here, and I have lived in the same house since 1992.  This is my home.

This easily is one of the most humbling experiences in my over 30 years of public service. This has been a campaign of experience vs. naivete.  It has been a campaign of a professional prosecutor vs. a person who has never tried a criminal case.  It has been a campaign of one ‚Äúindividually wealthy‚Äù campaign donor vs. a campaign of over 300 local elected leaders, Lane County residents, unions, and businesses.  It has been a campaign of a community vs. someone trying to buy the District Attorney's office.

This campaign has shown me that we in Lane County say NO to unqualified, misleading candidates who are funded by a single ‚Äúindependently wealthy‚Äù individual.

I cannot tell you how difficult it was - and continues to be - to ask for time and resources from our businesses, unions and residents. When I started this journey (after my opponent filed last minute and reported a $100,000 campaign contribution from ONE individual), I was worried about our businesses, unions, residents and, most importantly, our victims.  I was worried what would happen if we didn‚Äôt have an experienced and ethical leader in the District Attorney‚Äôs office.  I was worried asking for support for my campaign as I thought these groups would have bigger worries (COVID, economy etc.).  I was wrong. The unparalleled and uncompromising support I have received from our businesses, unions, residents and victims has been humbling. Words cannot begin to explain the gratitude I have for our community coming forth to support me in such a difficult time.

With the election coming up I asked my campaign team to put together metrics of our campaign. I asked this because I am proud of what we have done.  

Here are the key metrics from our campaign:  

We raised over $100,000 from over 240 individuals, businesses, unions and victims. 

Our largest campaign contributors, by far, are the prosecutors in my office.  They are represented by Lane County Prosecuting Attorneys Association. These individuals know who they want mentoring and guiding them. They are in a uniquely informed position to determine who will be best to serve the office of Lane County District Attorney.  I received unanimous support from the Lane County Prosecuting Attorneys Association. They have supported my campaign in many ways; with their words of support, with their personal funds, with their collective funds and with their time volunteering on my campaign.  They know who they want to lead them and I feel honored to be that person. This is incredibly special to me.

We received the endorsement of two of our main newspapers, the Register Guard and the Eugene Weekly. 

We received the endorsement of all five Lane County Commissioners. They represent nearly every political party and every geographic district in Lane County.

We received the support of businesses and unions collectively. They are sending the message that Lane County is not for sale and that having an experienced District Attorney is more important than one individual donor‚Äôs wants and wishes.

We received the support of nearly every current and former Lane County Sheriff, District Attorney and police unions.  These are individuals who know our criminal justice system in and out and can make an informed decision.  The list of law enforcement supporting us is too long to list but includes..

- Lane County Sheriff Cliff Harrold

- Sheriff Byron Trapp (ret.)

- Lane County District Attorney Doug Harcleroad (ret.)

- Lane County Peace Officers Association

- Eugene Police Employees Association

- Springfield Police Association

- Florence Police Department Association

- And others!

We received the support of many of the outlying town mayors and city councilors. 

I can easily say these metrics show this is a campaign of our community.  This isn‚Äôt my campaign.  This is the campaign of Lane County as a whole. It's not often our community can come together behind one candidate for a united purpose.  I feel honored to be the one our community has rallied behind.

With all of this said, though I have received so much, I ask for one more thing. I am asking for your vote.  I ask for your vote because I truly believe I am the right person for the job.  I believe my experience and integrity make me the person for Lane County.  With that vote you are entitled to something.  You are entitled to my unwavering commitment to our community and to the victims in Lane County.  And you will have, as you have in the past, my unwavering commitment to our community and the victims in Lane County.

Sincerely,

Patty Perlow

Quote, ""Governments that use the enormous power of law enforcement to punish their enemies and reward their allies are not constitutional republics; they are autocracies.""

To recap, Flynn was fired for lying to VP Pence and the American people, and was officially charged for lying to the FBI about material facts related to the investigation into Russia's attack on our democracy.

Notably, these actions were taken when Flynn was serving as National Security Advisor while simultaneously lobbying for Turkey.

It's a stark message these DOJ officials are trying to send:  Allowing indicted individuals accused of heinous wrongdoing to get kid-glove treatment because of close relationships to Trump is the politicization of the justice system. It is neither fair nor just, and will not be tolerated.

Florida's prisons are beginning to look like nursing homes as we grapple with the long sentences doled out in '80s and '90s.  If we ever want to bring sanity -- and humanity -- back to our criminal justice system, we must revolutionize the way we think about sentencing.  Our plan reduces the harmful effects of unnecessarily long probation sentences, makes prison a last resort and not a first option, eliminates the reliance on mandatory minimums and life without parole sentences, and seeks to give relief to those serving unjust sentences today.  You can see the full plan on our website, www.joekimok.com, or below:

--

Probation

Most people who are convicted of a felony are sentenced to probation. Probation may be appropriate for some folks as an alternative to prison, but our system overuses it and the length of probation sentences are far too long.  Long probation sentences are not only wasteful, they often inhibit the probationer‚Äôs ability to move on with their lives.  Through a cycle of probation, technical violations, incarceration, then probation again, long probation sentences keep those in our justice system trapped in a cycle that often does not end until probation is revoked.  

Because as a matter of course judges will often terminate an individual‚Äôs probation once they reach the half way point, Mr. Kimok will instruct his assistants that, in cases where probation may be necessary, they should not seek more than 2 years of probation without supervisor approval. 

Probation Violations
In 2017-18, over 18,000 people were sent to Florida prisons because of a technical probation violation ‚Äì meaning they did not commit a new felony, but rather broke some rule of probation.   And because of the way probation violations are scored under Florida‚Äôs Criminal Punishment Code scoresheet, someone who is sent to prison on a technical probation violation will often receive a longer sentence than if they‚Äôd just gone to prison in the first place. 

Mr. Kimok does not believe that people should go to prison for committing technical probation violations.  He will instruct his assistants that they are not to seek prison for technical probation violations without supervisor approval.  This simple change in policy will cause a significant decrease in Broward‚Äôs rate of new prison admissions.    

Restorative Justice Over Prison
We know that we cannot dismantle mass incarceration by focusing on non-violent crimes alone.  85% of Florida‚Äôs prison population is comprised of non-drug offenses.   Across the United States, 55% of all state prisoners have been sentenced for crimes legally considered to be violent.   To truly dismantle mass incarceration, we must have a plan that re-envisions justice for violent offenses in ways that help victims heal and make communities safer.  

Burglaries and ‚ÄúViolent Personal Offenses‚Äù cases are the top two offenses in Florida for new prison admissions.   In Broward County, anyone charged with either type of these offenses are not eligible for diversion.  A 2016 poll by the Alliance for Safety and Justice found that nearly 70% of victims prefer that people who hurt them get alternatives to prison like community supervision and treatment.   
Mr. Kimok believes we must help victims heal and help make them safer.  Prison, by and large, accomplishes neither of these goals.  In a Kimok Administration, folks arrested for these charges will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine the appropriateness of a restorative justice program.  This determination will be guided by a philosophy that puts the healing of victims and the long-term safety of the community first.  

Mandatory Minimums
Mandatory minimums have harmed families and communities.  They are economically wasteful, have not resulted in any decrease in sentencing disparities, and are disproportionately applied to minorities and the poor.  In Broward County, ASAs have the authority to seek mandatory minimum sentences where they see fit.  By and large, mandatory minimum sentences are used as plea bargaining leverage points.  The State announces it will seek a mandatory minimum sentence, then offer the person charged a lesser, but still substantial, prison sentence.  It is generally only folks who go to trial and lose who receive mandatory minimum sentences.  
In a Kimok Administration, no Assistant State Attorney will be permitted to seek a mandatory minimum without the approval of Mr. Kimok himself.  Mr. Kimok will only grant such a request under extraordinary circumstances. 

Life Without Parole
The United States leads the world in Life Without Parole sentences.   Florida abolished its parole system in 1994, so every life sentence in Florida is life without parole.  14% of Florida‚Äôs 95,000 inmates are currently serving a life without parole sentence.   
For most offenses, a life without parole sentence is barbaric, inhumane, costly, and unnecessary to protect the public.  Mr. Kimok will seek to significantly decrease life without parole sentences in Broward County.  He will also lobby the Legislature to reinstate parole and expand meaningful compassionate release of those serving such sentences.  

Sentence Review
As of June 2019, elderly inmates comprised 25% of Florida‚Äôs prison population.   Continuing to incarcerate many of these folks, sometimes decades after their crimes, is costly, inhumane, and does not keep us safe.  Every effort should be made to release people serving draconian sentences who no longer pose a threat to the community. 
Under Florida law, there are very few avenues for a State Attorney or judge to reduce a legal sentence.  Legal time limits constrain an inmate‚Äôs ability to reduce a legal but unjust sentence.  Nevertheless, Mr. Kimok will create a Sentence Review Unit, to look back at old sentences and investigate potential ways to reduce them.  He will lobby the Legislature to retroactively eliminate draconian mandatory minimum sentences and provide new sentencing hearings for those sentenced under such laws.",Joe Kimok for Broward State Attorney,999,USD,99,0,0,1,0

Mills:

Governor Janet Mills,

I am urging you to immediately reconsider your position, sit down with the Maine small business community and reopen Maine now. Following my announcement yesterday that I would be working with fellow Maine business owners to bring forward a lawsuit, dozens of Maine business owners and Maine people have reached out to join this suit.

This is not a partisan issue; this is a local small business issue. In addition, it extends past the business community. I have heard from dozens of Maine citizens, including home school groups that fear they will not be able to acquire their material for next year at the annual homeschooling curriculum event, from Pastors that fear their religious rights have been taken, to parents who worry about providing for their family if their employer remains closed, and mother of 5 and grandmother of 16, who will be joining to help reopen Maine to provide a future for her family here in our great State.

Governor Mills, we are here. We are ready to help you reopen Maine. The goal is not to sue the State, but ultimately, to ensure that we reopen Maine as soon as possible. Again, I am urging you to immediately reconsider your position, and work with the people of Maine, not against. 

-Dale Crafts

If you want to get involved and help bring this suit forward, please reach out to reopenmaine@dalecraftsforcongress.com.Together, as private Maine business owners, will use our experience to adapt and ensure that the Maine economy survives, while promoting public health.

HABBERSTAD - Letter to The Editor

""I have practiced law in Wasco County for 47 years. Starting in 1974, Wasco County has been served by only 2 District 
Attorneys. Bernard L. Smith was Wasco County‚Äôs District Attorney from 1974 to 1998. In 1996, Mr. Smith hired Eric Nisley as Deputy District Attorney. In 1998, Mr. Smith was elected as a Circuit Court Judge. Following Mr. Smith‚Äôs
election, Eric Nisley was appointed to replace Mr. Smith beginning January 1, 1999, and has held his position ever since. 

I recommend and support Eric Nisley‚Äôs re-election.
In arriving at this recommendation, I am not unmindful that Eric has gone through a 60-day suspension of his law license. Eric made a mistake when he provided
inaccurate information to the Oregon State Bar and he has paid for this mistake. However, I feel that we must balance this suspension against Eric‚Äôs excellent long term
service as our District Attorney. This balance favors him continuing in office.

Eric has displayed exceptional common sense and judgment in fulfilling his prosecutorial duties. Eric has always been reasonable in negotiating resolutions that
gave criminal defendants incentives to comply with the law in the future. On the other hand, Eric could be very tough on defendants who deserved it. Eric has and can ably try
a case when necessary.

Not only is Eric a skilled and capable prosecutor, but he is also an effective office manager. An earmark of a well-managed office is low staff turnover. When people begin
working for Eric they stay. Eric‚Äôs Chief Deputy, Leslie Wolf, has worked with Eric for 22 years. Eric‚Äôs other staff attorney, Sara Carpenter, has worked in the office for over 8
years. Every Deputy District Attorney that has left Eric‚Äôs office has moved out of the 7th Judicial District.
Eric has other staff employees who have worked in his office for as long as he has been in office.

I urge all Wasco County voters to join with me to return Eric Nisley to office.""

Here is why I am running:

1. to pass the heartbeat bill in PA - once a heartbeat is detected - no abortion. I believe life begins at conception, but the heartbeat bill must be passed in PA. My opponent, Mr. Galloway, will not fight for this bill and even voted against the pro-life movement on Dec. 12, 2017. Effectively he voted to allow dismemberment abortions up to 20 weeks in PA, but he says he is pro-life. This is unacceptable.

2. to pass HB 76 - this will cut property taxes in half for all PA homeowners and businesses. We believe it will be a magnet for new businesses and jobs in PA and will cause real estate prices to skyrocket. Moody's Economics studied the bill and agrees it's a big win for PA. My opponent likes this bill and has talked about it for 7 years. He just can't get it passed or won't fight to get it passed. With God's Grace, I will get it passed and we can start enjoying the benefits of this bill.

3. to make our schools the very best they can be. I've been a teacher for the last 20 years and we have some amazing teachers in our school system. I will work tirelessly to be an advocate for them and our awesome students in Harrisburg while being available for their needs here at home.

4. to bring a ton of jobs to our area. We are working with an economic team that have had exceptional success in business. We will be using proven strategies to attract NJ and NY fleeing businesses due to the high taxes and over-regulated industries. Texas has applied this strategy and is capturing many of California's unhappy companies. We plan to do the same.

I was born and raised in Levittown, PA, went to St. Michael the Archangel grade school, Conwell-Egan High School and Temple University. I am a teacher at St. Mark School in Bristol and have lived in Bristol for the last 10 years. I love this area and want the very best for our residents. I am a big supporter of President Trump. I am honest, hard working and I'm here to help. My name is Jeanine McGee. Thanks for reading and have a great day!

My grandfather, Naseeb ""Ance"" Damoose (pictured here) was a political leader who served as City Manager in Traverse City and other Michigan towns. He was born in the year 1900, just after his parents left their homeland and traveled by steamship to America to begin a new life. 

I believe, as he did, that it is important to understand how a candidate thinks - not just where he stands on issues. As such, I am beginning a series of posts with quotes from writings, speeches and other things that have influenced my ideas. 

The first installment is ""What Democracy Means to Me"" - a speech delivered by my grandfather as America braced for war in November 1940. In this piece, he writes, ""the greatest event of my life, the most vital incident in my career - the experience about which my very life began and will end, is the experience of having been born an American."" His Christian faith and deep commitment to defending American principles shine through in every page.
 
The words in this speech should be an inspiration to all Americans. I find them deeply moving today as our nation faces a wide range of challenges at home and abroad. Please click on the link below to enjoy.

Even beyond our current crisis, his words were prophetic:

‚ÄúHas it ever occurred to you how astonishing the culture of Western society really is? Industrialized nations provide their citizens with unprecedented safety, health, and comfort. Average life spans increased fifty percent in the last century. Yet modern people live in abject fear. They are afraid of strangers, of disease, of crime, of the environment. They are afraid of the homes they live in, the food they eat, the technology that surrounds them. They are in a particular panic over things they can‚Äôt even see‚Äîgerms, chemicals, additives, pollutants. They are timid, nervous, fretful, and depressed. And even more amazingly, they are convinced that the environment of the entire planet is being destroyed around them. Remarkable!""

Matthew 18:21 Then Peter came up and said to him, ""Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?""  22 Jesus said to him, ""I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven.

Jesus wants us to forgive those who have offended us.  Why, because God in Christ offers unconditional forgiveness to you. The act of forgiveness is a powerful response against our culture of retaliation and revenge. 

Ephesians 4:30 And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.  31 Let all bitterness and wrath (rage) and anger and clamor (verbal conflict) and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.  32 Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.

Colossians 3:13... if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive.

Issue a blanket pardon: 
Forgive everyone who has ever hurt you in any way. 
Forgiveness is a powerful act of grace. 
It sets you free from the past.

These unprecedented times of the coronavirus pandemic require that my work as the Mayor of Manhattan be my first and only priority.

On March 14, I met with the Leavenworth County Democrats. After this wonderful meeting, I immediately had to put on my Mayor's hat to take up Manhattan's fight against the coronavirus pandemic and its disastrous effects.Traveling home to Manhattan, I was continuously on the telephone with city staff and business and community leaders listening to their concerns and taking action regarding COVID-19.

Later that week, I paused my U.S. Senate campaign stating that my Mayoral duties came first. Today, sixty days later, things have not changed. My attention must continue to be focused on the people, organizations, and businesses of Manhattan and our region. Participating in our joint response to the pandemic is the most important work of my life. COVID-19 meetings and calls will continue to demand 100% of my focus for the foreseeable future. Working together, we will beat this virus and re-make our vibrant community and economy.

My Senate campaign was rooted in meeting Kansans where they live. Brian and I have enjoyed every house party, county gathering, KDP fundraiser, and advocacy meeting you invited us to. I‚Äôve learned so much from you and know we must continue to press for needed changes in improving health care, addressing climate change, strengthening public education, and protecting the right to vote. This fight has brought into further clarity the stark inequities we will need to address in our pandemic recovery program.

While I‚Äôm stepping back from my Senate candidacy, I will continue advocating for Democratic representation and policies that Kansans deserve now more than ever in Washington.

Thank you for your support.

The long-term liberal incumbent has hired a new consultant with some of the over one million dollars of special interest cash he‚Äôs received.  Now he‚Äôs using text messages in a desperate bid to convince us he cares about us. The latest message: offering to help fight property tax appraisals. Really?!?

In Aug 2017, the incumbent could have voted for property tax relief, saving taxpayers tons of money since that time. But he didn‚Äôt.  Instead, he voted with ALL but 3 of the Democrats against lowering the rollback tax rate!! Even 3 Dems got that vote right... not JD Sheffield! (SB1, Amd #10, 08/12/17)

Shortly after that, Sheffield could have fought alongside me and our taxpayers against an outrageous junior college tax hike. But NOPE! Instead, he took money from the college president and kept his mouth shut, leaving us to fend for ourselves. We The People beat that tax by historic margins with ZERO help from him!! 

And during this campaign? He took more cash from that junior college president to, what else, pay for ads to try to convince us he fights for the taxpayer. (Donations shown: https://tinyurl.com/SheffieldJrCollegeMoney)

In eight years, JD Sheffield has NEVER personally authored any bills to cut taxes or reform property taxes or appraisals or to lift the heavy foot of unfunded mandates off the throat of local governments!  But now, after an election where 70% of the people voted to FIRE him, now he‚Äôs going to help us taxpayers?!?

We‚Äôre not buying what he‚Äôs sellin‚Äô & like my grandparents used to say, ‚ÄúActions speak much louder!‚Äù

This farce needs to come to an end.  Now is the time for the people of HD 59 to reclaim this seat.  The incumbent went to Austin nearly 8 years ago and he never came back.  We can do so much better!

This election is about choosing an authentic conservative fighter for Central Texas. With your help & your vote that‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôll do!

My opponent in this race voted to take healthcare away from women. He voted to have the government intervene in a woman‚Äôs life. He voted to ban dilation and evacuation and to take the first step into making Kansas the first abortion free state. -- Thank god the Kansas supreme court intervened and ruled that an unconstitutional law.

Since 2015, state lawmakers (like my opponent) have begun to target the abortion method most commonly used in the second trimester, dilation and evacuation (D&E). Banning D&E is one of several trends to emerge from among the recent onslaught of state abortion restrictions, and the idea is rooted in a long history of efforts to limit access to abortion after the first trimester by enacting restrictions on specific abortion methods.

By restricting the most common method of second-trimester abortion, policymakers hostile to abortion would take a significant step forward in their campaign to eliminate abortion access in the United States. As with most abortion restrictions, the consequences would fall hardest on those already struggling to obtain access to abortion.

I, like everyone else want to get back to normal as quickly as possible. The economic devastation that has hit businesses and forced many to close is indescribable.

Ohio leadership has faced insurmountable challenges, and the decisions made with little time to contemplate helped save lives, reduce infections, and bought time to build up infrastructure, PPE and overall preparedness.

We have secured a supply chain of 12 manufacturers registered with the FDA with a combined daily production capacity of 16 million masks. We also have access to seven million masks available for next day delivery from suppliers with physical stock in the US to accelerate the mission of getting masks to as many people as possible as quickly as we can. If you are looking for masks, please visit our site.

I was in Tokyo and Taipei at the end of January and saw firsthand the culture of everyone wearing a mask. In these countries, a mask is part of everyday life. As a result, COVID-19 has not been as severe in these places in comparison to the western world. These countries have mitigated lockdowns, have democratically elected governments, are U.S. allies and sit right next to the epicenter of the outbreak. The comparison is shocking and can be found at facemasksforall.com/stats

The bottom line: facemasks make a difference.

I have come to this realization that stopping the spread of the virus is not what we should be doing. By not being exposed to it we are allowing it to hang around us in wait until it will come back and then we will shelter in place until we stop the spread and then reopen and shut down, re-open and shut down. This idea that staying in a never ending loop will ever end is insanity. We need to get off this ride and expose the healthy to it while the most susceptible are protecting themselves by wearing masks and quarantine; we will build, as a herd, the""herd immunity"" we need that will ultimately end the virus once and for all. I am looking at it in the long term. By not being exposed to it we are allowing it to hang around and come back stronger. This thing needs to run through us to it's end.

Here is the official Election Day and early absentee in-person locations map for the 2020 Primary. The Election Board did have to reduce our locations from sixteen to eight, due to half of our poll workers dropping out due to COVID-19. Also, we have had some locations back out of being vote centers as well. The Bartholomew County Election Board used previous election voter turnout data to decide which locations to utilize for the Primary. We wish we could use all of our locations and I sincerely apologize if your location near your home is not a location for the Primary. Please remember, you can vote at any location on this map or by mail (indianavoters.com to submit absentee application by the May 21st deadline).  These limited locations are only for this Primary due to the virus. 

Also, the courthouse WILL NOT be an early in-person location for this election due to the building still being limited to the public. Donner Center will have absentee in-person voting starting on Tuesday, May 26th - Saturday, May 30th, 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. Absentee in-person voting will also be on Monday, June 1st from 8:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. at Donner. 

Please be sure to let your voices be heard and get out and vote. If you have any questions, please call us at (812) 379-1604. Thank you and please take care!

2. Will it put our small businesses into a better or worse position to compete, succeed and survive?

It was the hospital. Tom‚Äôs mother had been euthanized, and it was time to take care of her affairs.

Tom was shocked. His mother had suffered with chronic depression for more than 20 years. But he had no idea that she was going to be given a lethal injection. 

He was devastated.

When euthanasia was first legalized in Belgium, most people understood ‚Äúunbearable suffering‚Äù to mean a physical terminal illness.

But today, 18 years later, deteriorating eyesight, hearing, and mobility‚Äîwhat we might consider normal aging‚Äîcan be considered by law as ‚Äúunbearable suffering‚Äù and be used to justify euthanasia.

Even more frightening, the next step was to legalize child euthanasia, which happened in 2014. There is now no age restriction on euthanasia for minors in Belgium.

Other countries are following suit and adopting these lethal policies. In the state of Oregon alone, the number of assisted suicides has grown by 1,000% in the last 20 years.

Up until the day Tom received that tragic phone call, he hadn‚Äôt given much thought to euthanasia laws. He didn‚Äôt think they affected him.

But the truth is, these laws could affect any of us.

Now is the time to stand together and STOP this tragedy before it‚Äôs too late.

Will you chip in $10 today and help fuel our impending legal battle to FIGHT the lethal spread of euthanasia and affirm the inherent dignity of every person?",Alliance Defending Freedom,999,USD,99,0,0,0,0

Indian immigrants (and only Indian immigrants) who have been approved for employment-based green cards are expected to wait 150 years for their green cards. Once the children of Indian immigrants hit the age of 21, they will have self-deport from the only country they can ever remember - just because their parents were born in India.  Removing national origin discrimination should be a no-brainer, which is why there is a bill that‚Äôs supported by 400+ members of Congress. 
 
Shockingly, the only Senator who supports the continuation of racist national origin discrimination against Indian immigrants is none other than Senator Dick Durbin. After 15 years of advocacy on this issue, Immigration Voice has concluded  that Senator Durbin‚Äôs opposition to equality is driven purely by a deep racial animus against Indian immigrants. We have footage of him dehumanizing Indian immigrants, using  various rationalizations to perpetuate  National origin discrimination and telling Indian Immigrants that he could not possibly be a racist because he has hired Mahatma Gandhi‚Äôs great-grandson.
 
Our fight for equality is driven by our determination that our children are worth no less than the child of an immigrant from anywhere else, and we will not accept Senator Dick Durbin telling them they do not belong in America. For more information go to http://DurbinIsRacist.com

Durante a√±os, el establecimiento pol√≠tico ha estado trabajando con desarrolladores codiciosos para vendernos, aumentar nuestra renta y robar nuestros hogares.

Yo s√© lo que es crecer con inseguridad de vivienda, despu√©s de haber pasado parte de mi infancia en el sistema de refugios de la ciudad de Nueva York. Esta experiencia me llev√≥ a pasar mi carrera luchando por la gente del sur del Bronx, trabajando para garantizar la vivienda como un derecho humano universal. Comenzando con mi tiempo en la oficina del congresista Serrano, he trabajado incansablemente durante la √∫ltima d√©cada para construir viviendas para los neoyorquinos y enfocar la justicia ambiental en mi trayectoria.

Ahora, nuestra campa√±a contin√∫a luchando por nuestra comunidad al asociarse con esfuerzos de ayuda mutua para entregar alimentos y organizar voluntarios para apoyar a nuestra comunidad durante esta crisis.

Es hora de dejar para atr√°s la pol√≠tica transaccional de nuestro sistema pol√≠tico roto y adoptar una pol√≠tica transformadora basada en la claridad moral y la valentia pol√≠tica para hacer lo correcto para nuestras comunidades. Es por eso que mi historial de votaci√≥n sin concesiones muestra mi rechazo constante de la fuerza corruptora de grandes sumas de dinero y el compromiso de luchar por una revoluci√≥n de la clase trabajadora que garantice que todos podamos obtener la atenci√≥n que necesitamos ‚Äî tanto en tiempos normales como en emergencias.

En el Congreso estar√© con la congresista Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez y otros combatientes de la clase obrera para luchar por nuestras familias, asegur√°ndome de que la vivienda sea un derecho humano a trav√©s de una Garant√≠a de Vivienda y el trabajo esencial se valoran a trav√©s de un Ingreso B√°sico Universal, y la atenci√≥n m√©dica sea un derecho garantizado a trav√©s de Medicare para todos.

Me postulo como una luchadora de la clase trabajadora en un campo de dem√≥cratas respaldados por las corporaciones. Nuestras comunidades quieren contar con nosotros para llevar esto a casa.

For thousands of families across the South Bronx, COVID-19 has deepened existing fears and uncertainties: making rent, having job stability, and accessing medical care. I know what it‚Äôs like to grow up with these fears, having spent part of my childhood in New York City‚Äôs shelter system. 

This experience led me to spend the last decade fighting for the people of the South Bronx. Beginning with my time with Congressman Serrano, I‚Äôve worked to ensure housing as a universal human right and center environmental justice. Our campaign is continuing to fight for our communities by partnering with mutual aid efforts to deliver food and organize volunteers to support our families during this crisis.

In Congress I will stand with the transformative politics of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the squad, fighting for our families by making sure housing is a human right through a Homes Guarantee, care work and essential work is valued through a UBI, and healthcare is a guaranteed right through Medicare for All. 

This race is filled with corporate-backed Democrats, that‚Äôs why Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other working-class fighters are counting on us to bring this home.

As I stated yesterday I plan on expressing  what my feelings are and why I am running for Johnson County Supervisor.   So here is my next thought:

Common sense needed in county government.

I have always been taught ""Look before you leap"".  This has to be done  in county government too.  I feel that too many times the county acts  before it thoroughly looks at an issue.  A good example of this is the  new  U.D.O.  There are parts of the new ordinances that should have been  looked at better before it was put into practice.  Supervisor Sullivan  even admitted during the League of Women Voters Forum that the rollout   of the U.D.O. could have been better!  We need to have common sense  returned to county government.  I think we need to ""Think twice and act  once""!

As your State Representative, I'll fight to increase teacher pay so we can retain our teachers and I will also fight to restructure the school funding formula so it works for rural districts, not just those in Santa Fe, Albuquerque and Las Cruces. Our students, teachers and schools deserve more. I'll be their champion!

Please vote for Matthew Elias Gonzales for State Representative - House District 40 in the Democrat Primary Election on June 2. Absentee & early voting is currently underway.

Thank you for your continued prayers and support.

Precinct locations where we normally vote will NOT BE OPEN ON PRIMARY ELECTION DAY. 

The Covid-19 Crisis pushed Kentucky's Primary Election from May to June 2020. The State Election Board and Local County Clerks have worked diligently to ensure we can participate in this election safely by enabling new procedures. The highlights of those new procedures, in Henderson, include the following: 

(1) All registered voters should request a paper ballot be mailed to them in order to vote. 

(2) You can request that ballot be mailed to you by: (a) telephone- call (270) 826-3906; (b) by email- email vote@hendersonky.us; or (c) a secure online portal that will be available through the State Board of Elections Website eventually.

(3) Once you have the ballot, you complete it, and it must be mailed back/post marked by no later than June 23, 2020. A return envelope with paid postage will be included with your mailed ballot. If you cannot return your ballot by mail, you can return it to a secured ballot box located inside Henderson's Old Courthouse by Central Park at the corner of 1st Street and Main Street. The ballot box will be available from June 8th through June 23rd.  

You can read more details about this procedure on the Henderson County Clerk's Website here: https://www.hendersonky.us/152/County-Clerk.

The Henderson City Commission is on the Primary Ballot this year. Candidates will be narrowed from the 11 currently running, to 8 that will go on to be considered in the General Election in November, when 4 will be selected. I would greatly appreciate your support and vote in the Primary Election.

""Floyd County residents,

I‚Äôm so glad I got to know Dave Roberson when we were both contestants in the 2017 Sexual Assault Center of NWGA's Rome Celebrity Dance Challenge. There‚Äôs nothing like going outside your comfort zone to bring people together. Since that summer, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs been an event I‚Äôve been in charge of or participated in that Dave hasn‚Äôt supported. I think it is safe to say that if Dave isn‚Äôt at your event, it didn‚Äôt really happen!

Dave Roberson has become a friend, but I‚Äôm supporting him for Floyd County Sheriff because I believe he is the right man to lead the office into the future. I know and respect all three candidates for Sheriff, and Floyd County is fortunate to have three qualified options for this Office. However, in my work as an attorney, I have an opportunity to work with the Sheriff‚Äôs Office on a regular basis, and when I have a problem or need to brainstorm how to make a sometimes rigid criminal justice system ‚Äúwork‚Äù in the real world, Dave is my first call. There has never been a time that I called that Dave didn‚Äôt respond quickly to help me work through the issue.

Vote Dave Roberson for Sheriff of Floyd County!

Chris Jackson

It‚Äôs never been more clear than now how important it is to have state leaders that have our best interests at heart. As a Doctor by profession, he realizes the importance of comprehensive testing that goes beyond Nasal Swab Test. Specifically, initiate Blood Serology tests that will tell us who is active, who has already been exposed and who may have already developed immunity to COVID-19 allowing us to get back to our new normal. The more people we test, the more science and data will show it is safe to return to normal.

Until we are able to get everyone tested, it is important that you continue using safe distancing measures. Wash your hands. Wear your masks. Consolidate trips in public. Together we can get through this and come out ahead. Head to https://www.realsolutionsfortn.com/how-to-get-us-back-to-normal to hear more about this 4 Part Plan.

TLDR; Governor Wolf has endorsed my campaign for state representative.

Wow! Words cannot describe how humbled and honored I am at this very moment to announce that Governor Tom Wolf has endorsed my campaign for State Representative.

Who would've thought that a kid from Reading who missed over 80 days of school one year would be able to garner the support from so many people and institutions, including the highest ranking democrat in state government in Tom Wolf.

As I accept this endorsement, I can't help but think back on the times my family struggle to make ends meet with bills. How I saw the pain in my grandmother's eyes when she needed to decide between paying for her insulin, or helping to pay our rent.

I think about my father, who came to this country at the age of 19 not knowing any English, to now one generation later potentially seeing his immigrant son serving his community.

I think about all the teachers, mentors, and kind people, who encouraged me, believed in me when I didn't believe in myself, and never let me stay defeated when I have faced adversity.

Mostly though, I think about the generational impact we will make in the years to come. I see myself fighting for working-class families, families just like my own.

I see myself working with Eddie Moran to transform our city.

I see myself helping business owners, and entrepreneurs earn their slice of the American Dream.

I see a change where more Latinos across our state run for office and win.

I see a future that is very bright.

 We need to have safe and reliable public transportation in our community.  As a long-time downtown business owner and civic leader, I have advocated and pushed for more security in these transit areas. The Met Council will need to look at design changes to make stations safer. No one should have to fall victim to this ever-increasing crime problem. With the Southwest LRT extension to the western suburbs (a $2 billion project, half of which is being paid for by Hennepin County tax payers) we need our safety ensured. I will demand accountability from key players and make sure that this issue is brought under control.

I have lived in Townsend for the majority of my adult life and have consistently volunteered during these past 35 years in the areas that interest me and that I believed might improve the quality of life in my town in some small way.   (I think this is something that all long-time volunteers do)
My first volunteer effort in Town was as a member of the affordable housing subcommittee for the Master Plan that was developed in 1986-87 (more below)

Currently, I am on the Planning Board.  I also serve as the Planning Board‚Äôs representative to the Capital Planning Committee and the Montachusett Joint Transportation Council (MJTC).  I am on Townsend‚Äôs Core Team for the grant-funded Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness Plan.  
This work has shown me how important it is to pay attention to where our tax dollars are going and also to the grant opportunities that could provide the town with support for much needed projects.  

I pulled papers for Selectman on January 30th.  After the Special Town Meeting in January, I thought instead of standing up and asking questions, perhaps I could contribute more effectively over the next three years as a member of the Board of Selectmen.  I am asking for your vote on June 29.

In a time when so many Americans are suffering, supporters of socialism say its policies and practice will help society‚Äôs most vulnerable.

Empty shelves and long lines at the supermarket ‚Ä¶ incentives to report on your neighbors ‚Ä¶ massive unemployment and economic uncertainty. In America, these are temporary symptoms of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is the everyday reality of life in socialist Venezuela. 

Jorge and Andr√©s escaped their home country of Venezuela after an oppressive regime crippled the economy, caused widespread starvation, blanketed the nation in blackouts, and silenced and jailed those who dared to speak out and criticize the government.

The recent crisis proves that Congress can pass bipartisan legislation quickly, and we need more of that from Congress.  

The solutions of yesterday will not work in an American economy that is rapidly changing and is continuously fueled by technology and globalization. My priority is to tackle issues that ensure the future of families, work, and communities so that Marylanders of Congressional District 7 can compete and thrive in Future America. 

I am currently petitioning to run as an independent candidate for Maryland‚Äôs 7th Congressional District, previously represented by Rep. Elijah Cummings and currently represented by Rep. Kweisi Mfume, in the November general election. 

To get on the ballot I need about 5000 signatures from voters in MD7. If you are interested in my platform, go to ivey2020.com/sign to sign the petition. 

People say running as an Independent is a wasted vote. But what has your vote done for you lately?

I am committed to bringing my skills and experience to Washington to make Congress work again, so that we can prepare for the threats of today and tomorrow.

Living on a fixed income and overwhelmed with credit card debt, Gina decided to come to Tabor. The staff at Tabor's Ann B. Barshinger Financial Empowerment Center were able to work with Gina's creditors to have her interest rates reduced. Today, she knows that she can't always just buy what she wants, and she has a reasonable and achievable budget. Through the process, Gina has learned some difficult lessons, but is now prepared for a future of financial self-sufficiency.

If you aren‚Äôt in a place to give right now, we understand. If you can give on 5/21, please give generously to ensure that everyone in our community has a safe place to call home. Can‚Äôt wait to give? Give now by visiting https://bit.ly/tabor521 or send a check to PO BOX 1676, Lancaster, PA 17608.

First, it‚Äôs a big country. I can guarantee that not everyone thinks or feels the same way about the virus as you do. My purpose here is to educate, not entertain partisan bickering or policy disputes. We are everyday Americans who understand that We the People are ultimately in charge of our government. Many of us are confined to our homes, unable to exercise our constitutional rights and liberties. The question is, what can we do?

First, VOTE. Having made that a priority, you can do many things, like talking to neighbors, write the Justice Dept., even protest if you feel safe to do so. I was advised NOT to join a protest last weekend because ‚Äúthere are people with rifles, confederate flags, n‚Äôer do wells, and ulterior agendas who show up there.‚Äù If you‚Äôve hung around this page, Common Sense Civics and Citizenship, for any length of time, you know that we encourage citizen participation, mainly through learning our founding documents and basic civics. Of course, I drove by the protest! Got people at the stoplight to honk in agreement with me. We waved, honked horns, and cheered on the display of American flags. There were no confederate or anti-American symbols, and no guns (although it is your 2nd amendment right to protect yourself). These were everyday Americans who believe in their 1st Amendment right to peaceably assemble and to petition their government with a redress of grievances. 

Here‚Äôs something else you can learn to do. Two bills in the House of Representatives are HR6666 and HR6585. I did some research to see where these bills are. Here‚Äôs how to do it:
Search ‚ÄúLegiscan. com‚Äù for information about the bill.
Search ‚ÄúCongress. gov‚Äù for the official text of the bill
Read a summary to get an idea of what the bill is proposing. Remember, Congress is there to serve us. We elected them. Your emails and polite voice messages count. We don‚Äôt think they do, but they do make a difference!
Take action. Call or email your congressman. It‚Äôs easy to find their name and contact information. Every Senator and Representative has a website. Or, find other like-minded citizens to join in representing your views.

You can learn a lot of information, like the status of the bill, who sponsored the bill, what committee it was referred to (if any), and other information. You can read comments from fellow Americans. Yes, it takes up some of your valuable time. Anything worthwhile takes time. 

Let‚Äôs take a brief look at HR6666. According to Legiscan, it is:
‚ÄúCOVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act This bill authorizes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to award grants for testing, contact tracing, monitoring, and other activities to address COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019). Entities such as federally qualified health centers, nonprofit organizations, and certain hospitals and schools are eligible to receive such grants. In awarding the grants, the CDC shall prioritize applicants that (1) operate in hot spots and medically underserved communities, and (2) agree to hire individuals from the communities where grant activities occur.‚Äù

We learn this about HR 6666 from Congress‚Äô official text of the bill on Congress. gov:
‚ÄúTo authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID‚Äì19, and related activities such as contact tracing, through mobile health units and, as necessary, at individuals‚Äô residences, and for other purposes.‚Äù

A citizen might ask questions like: Is the CDC constitutional? Where in the Constitution does it legally and explicitly authorize this government agency? Are they allowed to give grants for such activities, like going to individual residences as they deem necessary? What does the phrase ‚Äú for other purposes‚Äù mean? What are those purposes? Will I be able to refuse a visit from those who receive these grants, if the bill passes? What is the cost to me, the taxpayer?

Yes, there are lots of questions you might ask. On the other hand, you may yawn at all of this legislative jargon. It is your rights and those of your posterity that are at stake. People often write to me and say that we need to keep Congress accountable. This is one way to do it. 

Everything we aspire to depends on the government we have. It‚Äôs essential now more than ever to be informed.

Biography: 

Andrew David Brunni

Age: 27

Education: Purdue University, B.A. 2014; Indiana Wesleyan University, Master of Public Administration(MPA) 2018

Occupation: Owner, Brunni Marketing Solutions; Marketing Director, Donut Central

Community: Member, Grace Lutheran Church; Elder 2017-2019, Grace Lutheran Church; Management Board Member Grace Lutheran Church 2019-Present.

Family: Marlena Brunni, Co-Owner of Donut Central

Q: What would your priorities be for the next four years as a county council member?

A: I want to focus on implementing a three term limit to anyone elected to the Bartholomew County Council. Just as other county positions are term limited to protect the people, I feel the County Council should be as well. I will be a voice against increasing taxes and wish to reduce the tax burden on Bartholomew County residents. I will not vote to increase the tax burden. I support Bartholomew County becoming a 2nd Amendment Sanctuary. My platform is available online at andrewbrunni.com.

Q: With high unemployment, revenue from local income taxes is likely to significantly drop. If budget cutting becomes necessary, what departments or services are likely to be most affected?

A: Although we do not know the future economic impact of the COVID-19 shutdown, many employers are signaling a return to operations. As far as departmental funding goes, I believe it is always in the taxpayers' best interests for departments to look where they can save money and be more efficient in all times, including during this crisis. 

Q: Prior to the increase in local income taxes, several efforts were undertaken to make all county departments run as efficiently as possible?  Are the departments still running financially efficiently?  Are there additional efficiencies you would recommend now?

A: Over the last decade, taxes have been increased on the residents of Bartholomew County multiple times. Instead of the tax-and-spend culture we currently have, county leadership needs to run departments efficiently and without waste. Individuals and companies cannot simply tax someone else to help their balance sheets, the government shouldn't be doing so either.",Andrew Brunni for Bartholomew County Council,999,USD,99,0,0,1,1

That‚Äôs an important goal that we share -- but putting our entire Constitution up for grabs isn‚Äôt the right way to get it done.

In fact, the same billionaires who are buying our elections now would spend millions to make sure a convention, regardless of why it‚Äôs called, goes their way -- not ours. We can‚Äôt let this good cause -- getting Big Money out of politics -- expose us to a total corporate takeover through an Article V convention.

The best way to address money in politics is by putting ordinary people back in charge with solutions like small-donor public financing, requiring that all political spending be disclosed and transparent, and holding special interests that break the rules accountable.

An Article V convention won‚Äôt do anything to stop the Supreme Court from siding with Big Money -- because they‚Äôve already shown they‚Äôre willing to twist the Constitution to justify whatever they want. And, a convention could seriously endanger our most cherished rights in the process.

While this is a time of crisis for all of us, members of our law enforcement community deal with crises every single day throughout their professional career. We‚Äôre extremely blessed to have such excellent officers serving our community. 
In our weekly COVID-19 briefing call with the White House, Texas Governor Greg Abbott highlighted some of what his state was doing in terms of the CARES Act and re-opening. We were also informed over the call that 9.3 million tests have been conducted in this country and that the percentage of tests turning up positive on a daily basis continues to decline.

We will provide you with an update of our understanding of that conference in tomorrow‚Äôs update. It is, of course, our very sincere hope that the Governor announced a prompt re-opening of New Mexico, with reasonable protective safety measures in place.    
There‚Äôs also another announcement from the New Mexico Department of Health. All New Mexicans who want to can now get a free test to determine whether they have COVID-19, regardless of whether they have symptoms associated with the virus. The Department of Health said expanded testing began on Tuesday.  Eddy County‚Äôs two Public Health Offices are both continuing testing Monday through Friday, both now from 8:30-10:30 a.m. each morning. Please note the new hours.

Special thanks to Connie Caldwell with Goodlife and Barbara Granger Salmons with Encompass Health for setting it up. 
Lakeview Christian Home has also announced a parade around its building on Pierce Street at 4 p.m. Friday (May 15) to honor National Nursing Home Week. Residents who wish to participate will be brought outside to watch, with social distancing in place.  The plan for parade participants is to meet in the Buffalo Wild Wings parking lot by 3:45 p.m. and follow police and fire around the building twice. Please show your support. 
Congratulations to Cavegirl Coach John Zumbrun and the basketball team‚Äôs coaching staff for putting together a special way to honor the team‚Äôs seniors this year. On May 9, parents and coaches drove through town and stopped at the houses of all five graduating seniors, according to reporter Matthew Asher.

The Department of Health has detected community spread in the state of New Mexico and is investigating cases with no known exposure. The agency reports that given the infectious nature of the virus it is likely other residents are infected but yet to be tested or confirmed positive. To that end, all New Mexicans have been instructed to stay home except for outings absolutely necessary for health, safety and welfare. These additional restrictions have been enacted to aggressively minimize person-to-person contact and ensure spread is mitigated. New Mexicans are strongly urged to limit travel to only what is necessary for health, safety and welfare.

The New Mexico Department of Health has active investigations into the positive patients, which includes contact-tracing and swabs of symptomatic individuals who have had contact with the positive cases.

Every New Mexican must work together to stem the spread of COVID-19. Stay home.

New Mexicans who report symptoms of COVID-19 infection, such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and/or loss of taste or smell should call their health care provider or the NMDOH COVID-19 hotline immediately (1-855-600-3453).

Thanks to increased statewide testing capacity, the following people may now be considered for COVID-19 testing: 
Asymptomatic people who are close contacts or household members of New Mexico residents who have already tested positive for the coronavirus;
Asymptomatic residents in nursing homes;
Asymptomatic people in congregate settings such as homeless shelters, group homes, detention centers;
Asymptomatic people who are currently working;
Symptomatic people displaying the COVID-19 symptoms of cough, fever, shortness of breath, chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and/or loss of taste or smell.
New Mexicans who have non-health-related questions or concerns can also call 833-551-0518 or visit newmexico.gov, which is being updated regularly as a one-stop source for information for families, workers and others affected by and seeking more information about COVID-19.

It used to take me 40 minutes on the subway to reach my 75-year-old client in Upper Manhattan.

I immigrated to New York City from the Dominican Republic eight years ago and am largely the only one supporting my family of five. Not only do I have to find money for my own masks and disposable gloves, I also have to provide protective equipment for my client when I take him to the doctor.

I have cared for many over the last twenty years; first as a certified nursing assistant and most recently as a personal care attendant for my parents. Being in home care, it can be isolating. This is a role that many have looked down on. 

I am constantly reminded that this is not a ‚Äújob.‚Äù They are right. Not everyone can be a caregiver, it takes a special set of skills to care for people with disabilities and seniors. It is an honor to be able to find someone who is able to care for your parent, grandparent, or child. We play a special role in their lives that deserves respect. 

During this crisis, I continue to focus on caring for my parents and those who have become like family despite the uphill battle we face. I am taking all of the necessary precautions to keep me and them safe, but I do need access to protective gear. My life and those I care for matter. 

Home care workers should not be facing a shortage of materials when we work with an immunosuppressed population. As we navigate forward, my biggest concern remains the uncertainty.

He was talking with Dr. Anthony Fauci during a Senate hearing, and what Sen. Scott said was exactly right. Those who believe preventative measures should never have been taken are ignoring the immeasurable toll that would have had on human lives and our healthcare systems. I believe that‚Äôs an extremist point of view.

Equally extreme, in my opinion, are those who claim that now is not the time to consider safe steps towards re-opening our economy.  This viewpoint ignores the likelihood of CATASTROPHIC economic damage and widespread poverty, as countless economists have predicted will happen if we can‚Äôt find a way to safely get Americans back to work.

THESE ARE BOTH FALSE CHOICES.  It is NOT government overreach to take precautionary measures based on data and medical expertise. Nor is it somehow ‚Äúreckless‚Äù to look at calculated, reasonable steps to re-open South Carolina and our nation.

From the start of this pandemic, the partial shutdown of our economy and stay-at-home recommendations were ALWAYS meant to be temporary. The objectives have never changed: (1) ‚Äúflatten the curve‚Äù to keep our healthcare systems from becoming overwhelmed, and (2) give our nation time to ramp up its response efforts.

All things considered, South Carolina has done quite well so far. In fact, as Dr. Fauci told Sen. Scott today, our state has ‚Äúput things in place that I think would optimize your capability of reopening.‚Äù He went on to say, ‚ÄúI almost want to clone that and make sure other people hear about that and see what [South Carolina has] been doing.‚Äù

So when we talk about re-opening our economy here in South Carolina and across the nation, we need to hold to account people who intentionally lie about what that really means, or use scare tactics for cheap political points. Only to the uninformed does the term ‚Äúre-open‚Äù mean things like forced gatherings, or lessening our prevention efforts, or leaving those who are vulnerable out to fend for themselves.

Instead, when we talk about plans for re-opening, this is what it includes:

‚úÖ We should continue working to protect those most at risk. (e.g. elderly, those with underlying health concerns, etc.)

‚úÖ We should continue our extraordinary efforts to ramp up testing and tracing.

‚úÖ We should continue to reinforce the healthcare facilities throughout our state.

‚úÖ Development of both vaccinations and therapies is already happening at a breakneck speed.

‚úÖ We should continue efforts to help businesses weather this storm, like the EIDL and PPP programs, without being bogged down in efforts to ‚Äúrestructure things to fit our vision.‚Äù

‚úÖ We should continue to refine and improve the guidance and resources that employees and employers need to help keep their workplaces safe.

‚úÖ We should continue to encourage remote work whenever it‚Äôs possible and practical.

Last year, our state legislators in BOTH parties voted to give state judges a HUGE salary hike and pension hike - many of whom are already collecting both at the same time.

For powerful legislators who are lawyers like Liberal Jay Lucas, Luke Swamp Rat Rankin and Murrell Smith, it's a sweet money-making scam.

Also thanks to Statehouse politicians, this scam has blown a $100 million hole in the already mismanaged, debt-ridden state employee pension system.

Some experts say the pension system is $80 billion (with a ""b"") in the hole.

So what happens if the state employee pension system can't make - or falls short - on payouts?

According to the state Constitution, it could all South Carolinians pay an automatic, unlimited PROPERTY TAX HIKE until the debt is paid off.

State legislators used our money to payoff the judges the appoint.

Now we could be picking up the tab.

Marcus Sewell made a point to come to my house and share with me his vision if elected to be our next Sheriff.
‚û¢ He pledged to spend our tax dollars wisely to ensure deputies and staff have the best and most modern equipment.
‚û¢ He wants to work with County leaders and address in a meaningful way employee recruitment and retention.
‚û¢ He talked about plans to address the rapid growth and expansion we are seeing in Dawson County. History tells us with rapid growth, criminals soon follow.
‚û¢ He pledged to keep our children and citizens safe and do so in an open and transparent manner.
Marcus spent about an hour talking to me about these topics and others. I spent 44 years working in the criminal justice field as a GBI agent, Deputy Sheriff, and college professor. I believe his ideas are sound and will work. I encourage you to listen to Marcus as I did and see for yourself. I trust him, and I think you can too.

For those who are just getting to know me, from 2016 - 2018 I had a weekly column in the Advertiser. About 1/2 of my writings made it to their online presence, and about 1/2 did not. For the most part, I stopped my weekly editorial when I became Chairman of County Council in January of 2019. 

Over the coming weeks, I will be resharing those writings, as they share my core convictions of what is needed for a revival in our republic, in more ways than one. In the end, I believe more unites us, than divides us - and most of the issues we face genuinely are not partisan issues, but non-respecter of person issues.  As we approach Election Day on June 9th, I feel it is important for you to get to know my core convictions, which I have been writing about for over a decade. 

I hope all y‚Äôall are having a blessed week!

Hedge funds are betting on gold as a way to maximize returns during the unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus. 
But James Richman, chief executive and chief investment officer at JJ Richman said: ""Gold needs to take a breather and pull back a little lower first before we can talk about any continuous rising from this point.""

Gold could spike higher if Federal Reserve Chair Powell says that negative rates are still on the table. However, that hasn‚Äôt been his style so he is likely to downplay the idea, which could drive gold prices lower if he is convincing enough.

Essentially, as the easing of coronavirus restrictions goes, so too will go the economic recovery and the gold market. In other words, gold will feel pressure as long as countries and states continue to lift restrictions and the coronavirus curve continues to flatten. But a resurgence in new cases or renewed restrictions would be supportive for gold because this would likely lead to new stimulus measures.

In case you weren't able to watch Tuesday night's Common Council meeting, I asked two questions related to the City's budget outlook:

1.) Can background be provided as to why the City did not choose to extend the 2nd quarter property tax grace period to June 1st?

I was surprised to hear that the City's cash position did not allow us to extend this courtesy to taxpayers by even one month (as Governor Phil Murphy permitted and neighboring communities have). 

2.) Prior to the May 26th Council meeting, would the city consider hosting a budget workshop to explain in greater detail the assumptions underlying the budget amendments under consideration?

While hearings as part of regular Council meetings provide time for public questions, a dedicated workshop would allow our elected officials and City staff the opportunity to share in greater depth the new assumptions we are operating under and facilitate a much-needed discussion of the City‚Äôs financial priorities as we move through and ultimately out of this crisis. 

Let's help our elected representatives and city staff navigate these difficult times while continuing to honor our traditions of transparency and inclusion. If you would like to join the call for a dedicated budget workshop, please sign the petiton found within this article.

Rumblings are beginning to be heard in Washington over additional stimulus to the economy. As to be expected,  the concerns are more pronounced on the Republican side of the aisle,  but there will be Democrats, wanting to be viewed as responsible, who will likewise express reservation over additional stimulus spending.

We need to be clear in our own minds about what is taking place here. We can confidently place the deficit-mongers into two categories. First there are those who think they know what they do not know in terms of deficit spending and its monetary and fiscal implications. Most politicians probably fall into this category. It is an unfortunate fact of life that politicians are so busy fielding constituent concerns, raising money, shaking hands, and attending high profile events, that it becomes humanly impossible for these politicians to engage in the serious intellectual endeavor which their job deserves. There are simply not enough hours in the day for politicians to engage in activities which maintain their positions of power and to seriously engage in in-depth exploration of monetary and fiscal issues. Consequently, they rely on  notions of monetary and fiscal theory, appropriate to another time, which  they learned during their undergraduate days or from hearsay which they have picked-up along the way.
 
Consequently,  these politicians  think of federal debt and deficits as similar to household debt and deficits, and believe these debts must be repaid. According to their misunderstanding,  future generations will bear the burden of this debt and furthermore federal borrowing  will drive-up long term interest rates, crowd-out private investment, slow employment and so forth. None of this is correct under current Federal Reserve practices.

There is a sharp distinction between a household budget and a government budget when that government has its own free floating currency. The U.S. Federal government is such a government. The U.S., via Treasury Department spending,  and  Federal Reserve (FED) spending and lending, has the ability to create all of the money it would like to create. If you or I had this ability, would either of us  be concerned about paying off our debts? Of course not, we would simply create more money.  It is likely that most politicians do not have this understanding. 

The ability  to create new money, however, is not without limits. Massive money creation without a corresponding expansion of productive capacity can easily lead to inflationary results. ""Too much money chasing too few goods creates inflation"" is a  paraphrase commonly accepted in financial  and economic circles. 

There are likely at least a few in Washington who understand the Federal government has unlimited capacity to fund whatever it would  like to fund and that the debt incurred to fund this activity need never be repaid.  It should also be clear to at least some Washington-types that inflation, historically a component of interest rate determination, need not drive-up long term interest rates. The Federal Reserve has demonstrated an ability to control both short and long term interest  rates through market interventions. To lower rates, the FED enters the market and buys securities which drives up the price of these securities, which, correspondingly, lowers interest rates. This ability to control interest rates and to provide unlimited liquidity eliminates the crowding-out-of-private-investment argument expressed by many Washington and financial elites. This is partially on current display as the Treasury adds trillions of debt to the Treasury's balance sheet but rates keep moving lower as the Federal Reserve enters the market and purchases most of the new Treasury debt.

Now this is the part we need to be very clear about. Among those politicians who understand monetary and fiscal operations and their impacts on private investment and interest rates, the real concern, only reservedly expressed, if expressed at all, is that all of the current new money creation will create inflation in the goods and services market. This, of course, would be from money placed into the hands of consumers like you and me. You will  see some pushback against additional ""one-time"" payments for those under certain income limits; there will also  be pushback against the further expansion of unemployment benefits. This pushback may not be significant enough to prevent  additional money from flowing into the hands of  working Americans as we are still early in this crisis and, afterall, there is an election this fall. But rest assured the pushback against putting additional  money into the hands of working Americans will eventually succeed unless working Americans demand otherwise. To date, working Americans have accepted the claims that today's deficits will  create hardship for our children so we have willingly  gone along without adequate resources today in the hope that our children will have a better life tomorrow. But this is a nonsense argument given  the system's proven ability to control interest, provide unlimited liquidity, and continually roll over its debt.

In terms of inflation itself, among financial market participants, there is little consensus on the inflation issue. There are those who believe, due to massive unemployment and declining consumption, that we may enter a deflationary period of falling prices. There are others who believe the current massive money creation will result, in light of the various supply constraints, in ""too much money chasing too few goods"" which will create inflationary pressures. The financial markets want neither deflation or rapid inflation; these markets prefer predictable, stable, moderate inflation.
 
When it comes to the placement of money directly into the hands of working Americans though ""one-time"" payments, through expanded unemployment benefits, or even a Basic Income Guarantee (BIG), those few politicians who understand monetary and fiscal operations will base their decisions, not on debt burdens, but on their view as to the inflationary impact of these payments, which is actually the correct thing to consider. This consideration, however, exposes the capitalist system for what it truly is, or at least what it has been to date, which is a system which  is unable to meet the needs of all people in a non-inflationary environment.

This may have changed. It is possible that we have reached a stage of productive capacity wherein the needs of all members of the working class can be met in a non-inflationary environment through the provision of a Basic  Income Guarantee or other support programs. But we may not be able to discover if this is true because if a BIG, for example, did prove to be inflationary, once in place, the BIG will be difficult to remove.

Wanting to avoid this situation, the fear of potential inflation will lead the ruling elite to rely on trusted old theories of inflation which suggest that the placement of additional funds into the hands of the working class, without corresponding productivity increases, will create inflation. They will mostly rely on the debt burden argument but they will also eventually rely on the inflation argument to prevent the placement of additional money into the hands of the working class. Their argument will be that we should submissively cut our share of goods and services in order to prevent an otherwise inevitable cut in our share of goods and services due to inflation: inflation which is the result of our consumption of goods and services. It is a weird and rather weak argument.

If, in fact, the inflation hawks prove to be correct, and inflation does occur through a greater distribution of the nation's income to the working class, then both the FED and the Treasury will scale back their expansionary policies. If working people have to be thrown into hunger and homelessness in order to prevent inflation, then the system will once again have proven itself incapable of meeting the needs of all people and it should be completely restructured in a manner capable of meeting these needs.

Furthermore, the anti-inflation argument rings hollow in light of the FED's injection of trillions of dollars into the asset markets which has obviously inflated asset values well beyond the underlying economic values of these assets. Financial market participants and economists have overwhelmingly applauded this effort as having had a stabilizing impact on the financial markets, which it has, and oh, by the way, has also inflated the value of assets which these financial market participants hold.

Working  Americans should completely reject the argument that they need to accept hunger, utility shut-offs, and homelessness because increased debt will crowd-out private business or create hardship on future generations. This argument, as discussed above,  is nonsensical. They should also reject the argument that they need to suffer all of the above in order to control inflation. The working class  already consumes less than their fair share so perhaps efforts to prevent inflation due to overconsumption in light of current supply constraints should be directed towards other segments of the population.

It is possible that inflation will become an issue late this calendar year; but it's hard to state this with any degree of certainty, there are, at work,  many countervailing forces. But  if inflation  becomes an issue as we approach the new year, it will be important to keep these matters in mind. We need to be clear about what is going-on. 

Various segments of the population are fighting to direct money flows into their own pockets and the working class will only get what the working class demands. When it is all said and done, what we will likely discover is that the capitalist system,  as it is currently structured,   is incapable of meeting the needs of all people in a non-inflationary environment. Inflation creates financial instability and without FED accommodation in the asset markets will result in deflated asset values; this is unacceptable to the financial class. Inflation, within the current context will be inflation attributable to dollars distributed to the working class. If working class support through one-time payments, through enhanced unemployment benefits,  or through a BIG,  prove inflationary, rest assured  these programs will be cut, thereby proving, once again, the capitalist system's complete inability to meet everyone's needs.",Spiritual and Practical Socialism,999,USD,99,0,0,1,1

...in Congress this is known as a ‚Äúmessaging bill.‚Äù It allows the sponsors to stand on their soapbox claiming they‚Äôre ‚Äúworking for the American people‚Äù when in reality, the legislation is entirely about trying to advance a political agenda rather than addressing the issues at hand.

That‚Äôs exactly what happened Tuesday when a select group of liberals in the House proposed the much-anticipated 5th piece of COVID-19 legislation. This bill, H.R. 6800, should have been a bi-partisan effort to refine and improve upon the popular CARES Act, which passed overwhelmingly in late March.

Instead, what the House will vote on this Friday is literally a 1,815-page bill packed with unsustainable spending and blatant attempts to further the left‚Äôs agenda. Just thumbing through the legislation, we see numerous gems like these:

‚ùå It would enable illegal immigrants to receive $1,200 in economic stimulus payments by removing the requirement to have a Social Security Number, and replacing it with only an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number.

‚ùå It would impose federal mandates on how states must run their elections, particularly related to mail-in voting and voter ID.

‚ùå It would authorize additional multimillion-dollar grants for the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities.

‚ùå It would provide an extension of the enhanced unemployment insurance payments that have made it very difficult for many employers to recall furloughed workers.

‚ùå It would send over $900 billion in unrestricted aid to states and local governments. This is not the federal government‚Äôs role! It‚Äôs a horrible idea, as it would be used to support & sustain decades of fiscal mismanagement by many states. 

‚ùå It would provide a major break to millionaires and billionaires by removing the cap on the amount of state & local taxes that can be deducted from their federal tax returns.

I‚Äôm just getting started here, but the point is many of these provisions are completely unrelated to our COVID-19 response. Instead, they‚Äôre an effort to exploit this pandemic to advance an agenda.

Of course, ‚Äúmessaging bills‚Äù always includes some worthy elements, and this is no exception. After all, there HAVE to be a few good things in the bill ‚Äì that‚Äôs what enables proponents to claim you‚Äôre ‚Äúanti-something‚Äù if you dare question the legitimacy of their extraneous items. (Anti-children, anti-workers, anti-healthcare, anti-seniors, anti-law enforcement, anti-veterans, etc.)

Such will be the mis-characterizations you‚Äôll likely hear when conservatives vote against this proposal on Friday. It‚Äôs all so predictable and played out.

Yes, there are some elements in this bill that I believe are worthy of consideration. However, the bad far outweighs the good, and H.R. 6800 is not something I can support. Let‚Äôs hope the Senate will do a better job (A) understanding the impact of what we‚Äôve spent so far; (B) understanding where the real needs are right now, and then (C) crafting a better piece of legislation that speaks to the crisis we‚Äôre in, not to a political agenda.

While we have urgent and important things Congress must address related to COVID-19 and our economy, those who see this pandemic as ‚Äúa tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit [their] vision‚Äù are NOT helping matters right now.",Rep. Ralph Norman,5999,USD,99,0,0,1,0

My concerns as a Republican candidate for Congress.

Total deaths this year in our country are higher by more than just those reported as related to Covid19. In other words, instead of being overstated, as some are wishfully thinking, Covid19 related deaths are much more likely to be drastically Understated. 

In the midst of talk about rapid reopening of the Economy despite the CDC and Dr. Fauci concerns, among many other Public Health officials, this article is very important. Please take the time to read it.

I‚Äôm the son of a Ph.D. Research Scientist. I listen to science. It is clear that the Administration and Republicans like Andy Barr stuck their heads in the sand for two
Months. This resulted in tens
of thousands of unnecessary deaths from Covid19, and they are still climbing. Its time to change our Congressman. 

Please Vote Chuck Eddy Grassroots Republican for Congress in the Republican Primary. Mail-in ballot or in-person June 23rd. It‚Äôs important. Thank you.

My heart goes out to the families whose livelihoods depend on these events and the people they bring to our community. 

Our economy is fragile and one change can set a family back for years. Matt and I have usually been blessed with income from two jobs, but we have had tough times when we couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel. When our daughter got hurt I was with her for 5 months in Salt Lake and Matt was laid off. In 2002 and 2003 the drought was so bad that we had to sell half of our herd and sent the rest to California for the summer. Even now, we don't know whether we will be able to sell our calves this year. In hard times, we have received so much help from friends, family, and God above.  

At this time, many families who depend on tourism and events to make ends meet are going through one of the most uncertain times of their lives. For everybody whose finances and health allow, let's take this time to plan a staycation in Iron County this summer. Have a local restaurant cater a block party. Buy gifts at local retail shops instead of ordering online. Stay in a local hotel for a night away. Plan a day in a local town that you've been too busy to really visit.

More importantly, the article is illustrative of how small business incomes work for those voters who aren't quite sure how things like profit margins on sales get factored for a business. The article demonstrates how restaurants can sell a lot (gross sales) but have high overhead that makes their profit margins and incomes low (which is the metric METRO is hitting them with for its new tax proposal).  

While many restaurants won't do $5M in sales and be hit with the business side of METRO's ridiculous $2.5 BILLION DOLLAR boondoggle tax, they can absolutely have lower sales of a say a million dollars pretty easily, but only realize a 7-10% profit margin. This amount, whether it's in their personal bank account or not, gets treated as ""income"" on their personal taxes and then combined with their spouse's income.  However, it's really the money they use for their operating costs in the next tax year to pay rent and employees and food costs.

It's a good example of how small entrepreneurs get kicked into the METRO tax marginal 1% personal income tax hit...even though most of the business income on their personal income tax return gets plowed back into their business. 

The way METRO has written this tax, it absolutely hits small business owners and dips right into their personal income that they use to pay their mortgage, buy things for their families, and maybe, even try saving a little for retirement...and that's only IF that income isn't already earmarked for business expenses.

The METRO tax shows the disconnect of politicians writing tax bills for taxes they'll never directly pay or have any experience with because most are just career government people like Metro President Lynn Peterson.  She has no CLUE what it takes to run a business, but she sure knows how to collect a taxpayer-funded paycheck.  And it shows.  This new tax will hit small business owners hard at a time many have to either fight like hell to get back open, or face bankruptcy court.

It's tone deaf, and highly inappropriate and a failure of career politicians like Peterson.

One of the slightly uncomfortable parts of campaigning for office involves the splashing of one's name about the community in an attempt to draw attention to their cause and vision. It‚Äôs a necessary part of the process, but one that I have tried to do in a way that is not a huge eyesore to our community.

A long time ago, I received the blessing of a local property owner to use their property for my purposes and I sought to devise something politically useful, but even more so, something that would contribute to the lives of those who might see it. Over time, I pondered over many different options and ideas and eventually, things just came together as they needed to. I sought out a local artist, one whom I had seen a little of his work and who I respected for his vision and artistic talent. When we spoke, I indicated to him a little of what I had in mind but also expressed to him that I desired that his art and artistic vision be an integral part of what we produced together. It was important to me that it be something that conveyed an important message, and something that in due time, could easily have my name as the commissioner removed, and remain as a beacon of hope and pride for the building owner and for our community. In a short time, Jordan Clark completely has delivered on that vision and presented me with what would come to be my favorite part of my 2020 Uintah County Commission campaign.

I love and revere the United States flag, and all that it stands for. It represents the values and liberties that we as Americans have and enjoy every day (Bill Shuster). It represents all that is good about small towns all across America, and it represents perfectly our hometown.

I express my thanks to the building owner for their faith in me and more than anything I express my deepest appreciation to Jordan Clark and Jordan Clark Art for seeing this interesting project through.

Peticion familiar con ""Perdon"" y proceso Consular.
Hablemos del ""perdon"" y Como llegar a la residencia por medio del perd√≥n I-601A.

I-601A, Solicitud de Exenci√≥n Provisional por Presencia Ilegal
Ciertos familiares inmediatos de ciudadanos estadounidenses o de residentes permanentes legales pueden utilizar este formulario para solicitar una exenci√≥n provisional por presencia ilegal bajo las Secci√≥n 212(a)(9)(B) de la Ley de Inmigraci√≥n y Nacionalidad antes de salir de Estados Unidos para presentarse a un consulado o embajada estadounidense en el extranjero para su entrevista de visa de inmigrante.

Exenci√≥n Provisional por Presencia Ilegal.

Desde el 4 de marzo de 2013, ciertos solicitantes de visa de inmigrante que son familiares inmediatos (c√≥nyuges, hijos y padres de ciudadanos estadounidenses) pueden solicitar exenciones provisionales por presencia ilegal antes de salir de EE.UU. para su entrevista consular. El 29 de agosto de 2016, se expandi√≥ el proceso de exenci√≥n provisional por presencia ilegal a familiares inmediatos de Residentes permanentes .

Los extranjeros que no son elegibles a ajustar su estatus en EE.UU. deben viajar al extranjero y obtener una visa de inmigrante, pero en la gran mayoria de casos sera por dias y no a√±os como solia serlo. 

El proceso de exenci√≥n provisional por presencia ilegal permite a las personas elegibles para una visa de inmigrante (los familiares inmediatos, familiares patrocinadas y personas basadas en el empleo, y los seleccionados para el Programa de Visas de Diversidad) que solo necesitan una exenci√≥n de inadmisibilidad por presencia ilegal, solicitar dicha exenci√≥n en Estados Unidos, antes de salir a su entrevista de visa de inmigrante.  Con el ""Perdon"" aprovado el tiempo en el extranjero se reducira a dias y NO a√±os como era antes del 4 de marzo de 2013

Este nuevo proceso fue desarrollado con el fin de acortar el tiempo que los ciudadanos estadounidenses permanecen separados de sus familiares inmediatos mientras est√°n en el proceso de obtener visas para convertirse en residentes permanentes legales de Estados Unidos.

El proceso de la exenci√≥n provisional por presencia ilegal no afecta la disponibilidad del Formulario I-601. La persona que no desea o no cualifica para la exenci√≥n provisional por presencia ilegal tambi√©n puede optar por presentar el Formulario I-601, Solicitud de Exenci√≥n de Causal de Inadmisibilidad, despu√©s de que un oficial consular del DOS haya determinado que es inadmisible en Estados Unidos.

Lo que usted necesita saber.

El proceso de exenci√≥n provisional por presencia ilegal no cambia el proceso de visa de inmigrante. A√∫n si su exenci√≥n provisional por presencia ilegal es aprobada, usted todav√≠a tiene que salir de EE.UU. para su entrevista de visa de inmigrante con un oficial consular en el extranjero. La aprobaci√≥n de la exenci√≥n provisional por presencia ilegal no le hace elegible para el ajuste de estatus en Estados Unidos.
Si se aprueba la exenci√≥n provisional por presencia ilegal, solo entrar√° en vigor despu√©s de que:
Usted salga de Estados Unidos y se presente a su entrevista de visa de inmigrante, y
Un oficial consular del DOS determine que usted es admisible a EE.UU. y elegible a recibir la visa de inmigrante.

DOS podr√≠a cancelar su proceso de solicitud de visa de inmigrante si usted no comparece a su entrevista de visa de inmigrante en una embajada o consulado estadounidense.
Si usted est√° en procesos de remoci√≥n, usted no es elegible a una exenci√≥n provisional por presencia ilegal a menos que sus procesos hayan sido cerrados administrativamente y no se hayan puesto nuevamente en el calendario de la Corte de Inmigraci√≥n de la Oficina para Revisi√≥n de Casos de Inmigraci√≥n (EOIR, por sus siglas en ingl√©s) por el Departamento de Justicia, para continuar los procedimientos al momento de que usted presente su Formulario I-601A.
Aunque USCIS no tiene previsto poner a los solicitantes de I-601A en procesos de remoci√≥n, USCIS seguir√° las normas y gu√≠as de las Notificaciones de Comparecencia (NTA, por sus siglas en ingl√©s) del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS, por sus siglas en ingl√©s) y de USCIS que regulan el inicio de los procesos de remoci√≥n.

While the world is consumed with fighting the pandemic, sadly, Iranian regime has directed most of the European aid for severely affected Iranian citizens to the proxies in Iraq and Lebanon, France government speaker reported. And recently expelled Doctors Without Borders assistance team while having over 40,000 COVID-19 fatalities.

Cunningly, Tehran reports a fraction of the true figure to hide incompetency of the corrupt, inhumane regime. In this regard, 166 prominent Iranian American medical professionals and health workers send a letter to President Donald Trump. They said: ‚ÄúThe much-needed humanitarian aid should only be provided directly to the people of Iran and not the regime.‚Äù

On April 9, 2020, Amnesty International‚Äôs Deputy Regional Director of MENA said, in the report.
Iran: Prisoners killed by security forces during COVID-19 pandemic protests  
‚ÄúIt is abhorrent that instead of responding to prisoners‚Äô legitimate demands to be protected from COVID-19, Iranian authorities have yet again resorted to killing people to silence their concerns‚Äù.
In this vein, 60 Iranian American Former Political Prisoners Ask U.S. President to Continue Maximum Pressure on Iran.

Instead, I see someone who is wearing not only a piece of cloth around their face but a powerful symbol of sorts that says: I care about you.

I care about you even if I don‚Äôt know you. 
I care about my community. 
I care about the medically vulnerable and immunocompromised.
I care about the healthy with no underlying conditions.
I care about the elderly and the children.
I care about those in our nursing homes and veteran homes and housing complexes and prisons.
I care about our nurses, doctors, healthcare workers, and cleaning crews at the hospitals. 
I care about our essential workers.
I care about those who don‚Äôt have the luxury to stay at home and those who do. 
I care about Republicans, Democrats, and Independents.
I care about my black, brown, and white neighbors, my poor and my wealthy ones, because I know this virus doesn‚Äôt discriminate. 
I care about all of you. 

I care about every single one of you.

It is a mask inscribed with invisible words, stitched together with love and worn with love. That‚Äôs all. 

It is a mask that effaces ego and reveals only a spirit of community.

It‚Äôs not a mask of fear but of courage, of strength. The strength of humility and vulnerability and concern for others.

And this mask, it says (screams): it‚Äôs not about me; it‚Äôs not whether I believe the threat of covid-19 is as much of a threat as they claim or about my political beliefs or whether it‚Äôs an inconvenience to me or whether I believe it‚Äôs a violation of my personal freedoms for some workplaces to require that I wear them. 

This mask screams: it‚Äôs not about me. It‚Äôs about us. 

Because what‚Äôs more important than my own feelings about this mask is that my neighbors, that all of you, feel safe. Because I also know that the more safe we all feel the more free we will all be. 

And the more safe we all feel the more likely we are to not only help combat this public health crisis bc we are doing our part to help mitigate the spread of this virus but because we are also inspiring consumer confidence and helping people feel safe enough to shop, invest, and help revive the economy. 

And so it‚Äôs a win-win not only in terms of our public health but our economic health. 

But the biggest win is it shows that we are capable of being united. 

The world is beckoning us to be better and kinder and less divisive, and we have a chance to do that now by adhering to social distancing guidelines, wearing a mask, and practicing personal responsibility. But personal responsibility both presupposes and necessitates a responsibility to those around you.
